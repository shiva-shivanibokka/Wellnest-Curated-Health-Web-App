**Heads Up!** 🚀 Welcome to the epicenter of our project’s awesomeness! The files in this folder are the building blocks 
of something amazing, so treat them with care. And remember, with great power comes great responsibility—if you’re 
making changes, make sure they’re worthy of the superhero status you now hold. ⚡️

Oh, and if you see a file doing something unique… it’s not a bug, it’s a feature! 😉
