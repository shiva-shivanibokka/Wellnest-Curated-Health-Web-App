## Usability Test Plan

**Test Objective**

The main purpose of this usability test is to see how easy and clear it is for users to interact with five key features in our app: Personal Health Tracker, Habit Tracking, Calendar, Challenge & Leaderboard, and the Onboarding Survey. These are some of the most important functions we’ve built so far, and they represent the core experience we want to offer — helping users build habits, track their progress, and stay motivated through community features.
We chose these features because they’re meant to be used regularly, and if they’re confusing or frustrating in any way, that could really affect how people feel about the app as a whole. Through this test, we’re hoping to see whether users can complete each task without help, how long it takes them, and how confident they feel doing it. We also want to understand where users might get stuck or hesitate, so we can make the app more intuitive moving forward.
Our goal is to get honest, practical feedback from people who haven’t used the app before. This will help us figure out what’s working, what’s not, and what could be improved as we continue developing the project.

**Test Description**

This usability test will be conducted with a small group of users who have never used our app before. The goal is to observe how they interact with five specific features: Personal Health Tracker, Habit Tracking, Calendar, Challenge & Leaderboard, and the Onboarding Survey. The version of the app being tested is the latest working prototype, which is accessible via a desktop or laptop browser.
Each test session will begin with a short introduction where the user is told they’re helping us evaluate how easy and smooth our app is to use. We will not give them any hints unless absolutely necessary. They’ll be given a set of five tasks to complete, one for each feature, and we will observe their process, take notes, and record the time taken for each task. If the user gets stuck, we’ll note when and where that happens, but we’ll let them try to figure it out on their own first.
Here are the five test tasks:

1. Onboarding Survey: Complete the onboarding survey that appears when the app starts.
2. Habit Tracking: Add a new habit (e.g., "Drink water"), set its duration, and mark one session as complete.
3. Personal Health Tracker: View your current streak and check which habits you’ve missed or completed today.
4. Calendar: Go to the calendar view, find the current week, and see your habit progress for the last three days.
5. Challenge & Leaderboard: Create a simple challenge (e.g., “Walk 5,000 steps daily”), invite a friend, and check the leaderboard to see your rank.

All users will perform these tasks on the same system setup: a Chrome browser on a laptop, with access to the prototype via [insert URL here]. We will also give them a short Likert-style questionnaire at the end to rate their experience with each feature. These users will be regular students with no prior exposure to our app, which helps us see how a new user might feel when using it for the first time.

**Test Participants (User Profiles)**

To reflect a range of real-world users, we involved five participants from diverse academic backgrounds and varying levels of tech familiarity. Each user was asked to complete a series of tasks using our app, and their interactions were observed to help us assess usability, clarity, and overall experience.

## Summary and Key Insights

Testing the five main features of our app with users from different academic backgrounds gave us a clearer idea of what’s working well and what still needs some tweaking. Most people found the onboarding survey and calendar really easy to use — everyone completed those tasks without any issues, and the average satisfaction rating for the **Personal Health Tracker** was around **4.6 out of 5**. Users especially liked how clearly the progress was shown and how simple it was to view their weekly activity.

The main challenge came up during **habit tracking**. One user couldn’t immediately find the button to mark a habit as complete, and another mentioned that the “Create Habit” button could stand out more. These seem like small interface issues but could definitely impact the experience for new users. We also noticed that while most users liked the idea of creating challenges with friends, one user needed a bit of extra time to understand how that feature worked.

Overall, the app’s core features were well-received, and users were comfortable using them without much help. Moving forward, we’ll focus on making a few interface elements more visible and improving clarity in some user flows. This round of testing was helpful in showing us where users feel confident, and where a few small changes could make things even smoother.

## Localization Testing

### Localization Plan

The WELLNEST application was evaluated for localization readiness across two language-region pairs:

- **en-US → es-MX (English to Mexican Spanish)**
- **en-US → en-GB (U.S. to British English)**

The goal was to verify that the application's text content, UI labels, and formatting adapt properly to different languages, cultural expressions, and regional conventions. The test focused on three core components:

1. Homepage tagline
2. Navigation bar
3. Log Habit form

Testing was conducted by manually switching UI text and labels using browser devtools and inspecting how well the layout and messages adapted to different translations and regions.

### Test Cases

| Test # | Feature          | Region/Language | Task                                             | Expected Output                                                              | Result |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1      | Homepage tagline | en-US → es-MX   | Replace tagline text with Spanish neutral phrase | “Track your habits” → “Sigue tus hábitos” fits and conveys same meaning      | PASS   |
| 2      | Navigation bar   | en-US → es-MX   | Translate nav items to Spanish                   | “Progress” → “Progreso”, “About” → “Acerca de” all fit and read naturally    | PASS   |
| 3      | Log Habit form   | en-US → es-MX   | Translate form labels and placeholders           | “Habit Name” → “Nombre del hábito”, “Value” → “Valor” appear clearly         | FAIL   |
| 4      | Homepage tagline | en-US → en-GB   | Reword CTA to use British tone/spelling          | “Track your habits” → “Keep track of your habits” fits UK tone               | FAIL   |
| 5      | Date Format      | en-US → en-GB   | Change date display format                       | “July 30, 2025” → “30 July 2025” on progress entries                         | PASS   |
| 6      | Units / Terms    | en-US → en-GB   | Update measurements and terminology              | “Sleep (hours)” remains same, but “Color” → “Colour” in UI (when applicable) | FAIL   |

### Results

Out of 6 test cases, only 3 passed. Spanish navigation labels and the homepage tagline adapted correctly to the `es-MX` locale. However, other elements did not update as expected due to hardcoded English text or lack of locale awareness in the UI.

## Code Review

### Coding Standards

The practices that our team has been following through the entirety of this project has been to utilize previous documentation and diagrams created to provide uniformity in naming conventions and direction when it comes to having a function complete it's goal. Regular review of the code created and submitted is performed by the GitMaster and Team Lead to promote working and efficient code that can be iterated on successfully and without further conflict. Regular use of comments within the code base and on GitHub has allowed easy understanding of the purpose of code and commits as review and error tracing is performed. Another key piece of organization was the use of multiple feature branches as needed so that team members had a way of segmenting their work and not impacting others.

## Self-Check on Security Practices

### Major Assets

Assets

**User Credentials:** Usernames, passwords, email, personal details like gender and full name.

**Habit & Health Logs:** Data about pre-defined and custom habits

**Social Connections:** Friends, friend requests, circles, and notifications.

**Session Information:** Authenticated user sessions and CSRF protection.

### Password Encryption

Passwords are encrypted using Django’s built-in set_password() method, which applies a salted hash using PBKDF2 by default. On the front end side the password is not visible.

!["Spass"](Files/Spass.jpg)

!["Spass"](Files/pass.jpg)

### Input Validation

In the Habit Creation process, only validated input is passed

!["value"](Files/value.jpg)
!["vPass"](Files/valuepass.jpg)

Similarly, in the search box, empty queries will not trigger to prevent unnecessary API calls

!["Search"](Files/search.jpg)

### CSRF Protection

On most HTMLS and JS files you can find traces of CSRF protection for instance in habit creation
!["CSRF"](Files/CSRF.jpg)

### Session Cookie

Session Cookie age is implemented to log out users after 1 hour of inactivity
!["Cookie"](Files/cookie.jpg)

### OOP Security Practices

By using many classes with small scopes, separated functionalities, and limited exposed fields, we ensure encapsulation

!["encapsulation"](Files/encapsulation.jpg)

### Field Visibility

Using Model Constraints and Field Visibility, we ensure data encapsulation.
Password is write-only to limit exposure

!["passwordencription"](Files/passenc.jpg)

### Abstraction and Inheritance

Using Abstraction and Inheritance from the Django library, we ensure user data safety when creating an account
!["userc"](Files/userC.jpg)

### Decorators

We limited access using decorators, such as @isAuthenticated and @login_required

!["decorate"](Files/decorate.jpg)

### Database Logic

Using a consistent order for our Friends model, we avoid duplicated and conflicting relations
