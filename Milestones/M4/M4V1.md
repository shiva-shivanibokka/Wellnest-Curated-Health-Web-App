## Usability Test Plan

**Test Objective**

The main purpose of this usability test is to see how easy and clear it is for users to interact with five key features in our app: Personal Health Tracker, Habit Tracking, Calendar, Challenge & Leaderboard, and the Onboarding Survey. These are some of the most important functions we’ve built so far, and they represent the core experience we want to offer — helping users build habits, track their progress, and stay motivated through community features.
We chose these features because they’re meant to be used regularly, and if they’re confusing or frustrating in any way, that could really affect how people feel about the app as a whole. Through this test, we’re hoping to see whether users can complete each task without help, how long it takes them, and how confident they feel doing it. We also want to understand where users might get stuck or hesitate, so we can make the app more intuitive moving forward.
Our goal is to get honest, practical feedback from people who haven’t used the app before. This will help us figure out what’s working, what’s not, and what could be improved as we continue developing the project.

**Test Description**

This usability test will be conducted with a small group of users who have never used our app before. The goal is to observe how they interact with five specific features: Personal Health Tracker, Habit Tracking, Calendar, Challenge & Leaderboard, and the Onboarding Survey. The version of the app being tested is the latest working prototype, which is accessible via a desktop or laptop browser.
Each test session will begin with a short introduction where the user is told they’re helping us evaluate how easy and smooth our app is to use. We will not give them any hints unless absolutely necessary. They’ll be given a set of five tasks to complete, one for each feature, and we will observe their process, take notes, and record the time taken for each task. If the user gets stuck, we’ll note when and where that happens, but we’ll let them try to figure it out on their own first.
Here are the five test tasks:

    1.	Onboarding Survey: Complete the onboarding survey that appears when the app starts.
    2.	Habit Tracking: Add a new habit (e.g., "Drink water"), set its duration, and mark one session as complete.
    3.	Personal Health Tracker: View your current streak and check which habits you’ve missed or completed today.
    4.	Calendar: Go to the calendar view, find the current week, and see your habit progress for the last three days.
    5.	Challenge & Leaderboard: Create a simple challenge (e.g., “Walk 5,000 steps daily”), invite a friend, and check the leaderboard to see your rank.

All users will perform these tasks on the same system setup: a Chrome browser on a laptop, with access to the prototype via [insert URL here]. We will also give them a short Likert-style questionnaire at the end to rate their experience with each feature. These users will be regular students with no prior exposure to our app, which helps us see how a new user might feel when using it for the first time.

**Test Participants (User Profiles)**

To reflect a range of real-world users, we involved five participants from diverse academic backgrounds and varying levels of tech familiarity. Each user was asked to complete a series of tasks using our app, and their interactions were observed to help us assess usability, clarity, and overall experience.

    1. Soundarya Srinivas
        Program: Graduate – Electrical Engineering
        Tech Comfort: Comfortable with digital tools and organized
        Notes: Found onboarding and calendar pages easy to use. Noted that the “Create Habit” button could be more obvious.

    2. Sani Hasan
        Program: Graduate – Robotics and Computer Science
        Tech Comfort: Very confident and experienced with apps
        Notes: Completed all tasks smoothly and quickly. Understood layout, calendar, and habit tracking features without any confusion.

    3. Neha Desai
        Program: Graduate – Electrical Engineering
        Tech Comfort: Moderately confident
        Notes: Skipped part of the onboarding survey. Took longer to find the calendar and had trouble figuring out how to mark a habit as complete.

    4. Madhura Gowda
        Program: Graduate – Electrical Engineering
        Tech Comfort: Comfortable and tech-aware
        Notes: Very smooth experience. Found all features intuitive and responded positively to layout and overall flow.

    5. Navneet Kaur
        Program: Undergraduate – Political Science & International Relations
        Tech Comfort: Relatively new to health apps
        Notes: Liked the onboarding survey but needed some help understanding the health tracker and how to create a challenge. Found the calendar and navigation clear.

## Code Review

### Coding Standards

The practices that our team has been following through the entirety of this project has been to utilize previous documentation and diagrams created to provide uniformity in naming conventions and direction when it comes to having a function complete it's goal. Regular review of the code created and submitted is performed by the GitMaster and Team Lead to promote working and efficient code that can be iterated on successfully and without further conflict. Regular use of comments within the code base and on GitHub has allowed easy understanding of the purpose of code and commits as review and error tracing is performed. Another key piece of organization was the use of multiple feature branches as needed so that team members had a way of segmenting their work and not impacting others.

## Self-Check on Security Practices
### Major Assets
Assets

**User Credentials:**	Usernames, passwords, email, personal details like gender and full name.

**Habit & Health Logs:**	Data about pre-defined and custom habits

**Social Connections:**	Friends, friend requests, circles, and notifications.

**Session Information:**	Authenticated user sessions and CSRF protection.

### Password Encryption

Passwords are encrypted using Django’s built-in set_password() method, which applies a salted hash using PBKDF2 by default. On the front end side the password is not visible. 

!["Spass"](Files/Spass.jpg)

### Input Validation
In the Habit Creation process, only validated input is passed

!["value"](Files/value.jpg)
!["vPass"](Files/valuepass.jpg)

Similarly, in the search box, empty queries will not trigger to prevent unnecessary API calls

!["Search"](Files/search.jpg)

### CSRF Protection
On most HTMLS and JS files you can find traces of CSRF protection for instance in habit creation
!["CSRF"](Files/CSRF.jpg)

### Session Cookie
Session Cookie age is implemented to log out users after 1 hour of inactivity 
!["Cookie"](Files/cookie.jpg)

### OOP Security Practices
By using many classes with small scopes, separated functionalities, and limited exposed fields, we ensure encapsulation

!["encapsulation"](Files/encapsulation.jpg)

### Field Visibility 

Using Model Constraints and Field Visibility, we ensure data encapsulation. 
Password is write-only to limit exposure

!["passwordencription"](Files/passenc.jpg)

### Abstraction and Inheritance 
Using Abstraction and Inheritance from the Django library, we ensure user data safety when creating an account 
!["userc"](Files/userC.jpg)

### Decorators
We limited access using decorators, such as @isAuthenticated and @login_required

!["decorate"](Files/decorate.jpg)

### Database Logic 
Using a consistent order for our Friends model, we avoid duplicated and conflicting relations
