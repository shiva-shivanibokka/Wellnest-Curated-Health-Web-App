# General Feedback

Thank you for the effort put into the documentation. I can tell the team is working hard to improve docs from previous milestones, which is great to see. However, I have to express some concerns about your current progress.

Based on the usability test work submitted, it’s clear that many team members either missed the UI/UX testing lecture or weren't fully engaged. A number of the mistakes present could have been avoided by carefully following what was taught, either during class or by reviewing the recordings.

More importantly, I'm concerned with the overall direction of your Beta prototype. I haven’t seen meaningful progress from your horizontal prototype to this version. Additionally, much of the feedback I provided earlier still hasn’t been addressed. That’s a serious issue, especially at this point in the semester because your Beta prototype is expected to reflect a more complete and polished product, and you're currently falling short of that mark.

**Beta Prototype Grade: 11/14**

Please make sure to correct all issues in M4v2. Time is running out, and you need to revise quickly.

## Usability Tests

The effectiveness section needs a complete overhaul. The current submission does not align with what was covered in class.

### Missing elements:
1. Five test plans (one per function tested).
2. Proper formatting as shown on slide 17. Each test plan should include all required components discussed in class and in the recordings.
3. The effectiveness testing table is incomplete:
   - Missing the `% completed` column (critical for measuring effectiveness).
   - Missing the `errors` column.
   - Table does not follow the naming conventions discussed in slide 24.

## QA Testing

All required test plans for QA testing are missing. One plan per non-functional requirement was expected.

---

## Code Review

Code review should be presented in two parts: internal and external.

### Internal Code Reviews
These were expected to show reviews completed since Milestone 1 (or since the new team lead took over). Internal reviews should be reflected in pull request approvals by the team lead for each feature. This process is essential—features should not be merged or deployed without a proper review.

### External Code Review
The external review from Hana is missing. Including just the email she sent is not sufficient, you must provide her full feedback and show how you responded to it.

## Self-Check on Security Practices

This section is good overall. However, you're missing screenshots from your database showing that passwords are properly encrypted. Please include that evidence in the next version.

## Beta Prototype

There are several issues that need to be addressed urgently:

- UI/UX improvements from the horizontal prototype have not been fully implemented.
- On the login page, the input fields for email and password are cut off, making it difficult for users to see what they are typing.
- The sign-up page is missing a checkbox or method for users to accept the terms and policies before account creation. This was already flagged in Milestone 3.
- Several components still contain hardcoded data from the horizontal prototype, especially when creating a Wellness Circle. In this prototype, you were not allowed to have hardcoded data since Beta prototypes are used by real users to test the overall functionality of the product before the final delivery. 
- There's no guidance provided to users about what a Wellness Circle is or how to use it. Helping users understand key features is essential for usability.

Unfortunately I could not continue testing because I don't see any significant improvement from last time the project was teste, there is still a lot of work to be done on your project. Please prioritize addressing the feedback above to get back on track for the final deliverables.
