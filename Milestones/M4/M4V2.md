## Usability Test Plan

# **1. Usability Test Plan – Onboarding Survey**

### 1.1 Purpose  
To evaluate how intuitive and easy it is for users to complete the onboarding survey and whether the flow sets up their experience effectively.

### 1.2 Problem Statement and Objectives  
Some users may skip the onboarding survey or not find it helpful. This test checks how comfortably users move through the survey and if the content feels relevant.

### 1.3 User Profile  
- Soundarya Srinivas – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, tech-comfortable  
- Sani Hasan – Graduate, Robotics & CS, very confident  
- Neha Desai – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, moderately confident  
- Madhura Gowda – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, intuitive user  
- Navneet Kaur – Undergraduate, Political Science, new to health apps  

### 1.4 Method (Test Design)  
Participants were asked to complete the onboarding survey upon opening the app. They were observed for any hesitation, skipped content, or confusion.

### 1.5 Task List  
Complete the onboarding survey by responding to the presented questions.

### 1.6 Test Environment  
All users accessed the app on a laptop with Google Chrome in a quiet environment.

### 1.7 Test Monitor Role  
Observe behavior, note areas of hesitation, and offer help only when users are completely stuck.

### 1.8 Evaluation Measures

| Test/use case | % completed | errors                     | comments                           |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Onboarding    | 100%        | Neha skipped halfway        | Completed by all except Neha fully |

### 1.9 Report Content and Presentation  
Most users completed the onboarding smoothly, indicating the survey flow is intuitive. However, Neha skipped midway, which may suggest fatigue or lack of relevance in the questions. To improve engagement, we recommend breaking the survey into fewer, more dynamic sections and showing a progress bar to help users stay oriented. Adding a short intro on why the survey matters might also improve completion.

# **2. Usability Test Plan – Habit Tracking**

### 2.1 Purpose  
Evaluate how easily users can add, update, and mark a habit as complete.

### 2.2 Problem Statement and Objectives  
Users should be able to create and track habits effortlessly. This test identifies if button visibility or flow causes friction.

### 2.3 User Profile  
- Soundarya Srinivas – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, tech-comfortable  
- Sani Hasan – Graduate, Robotics & CS, very confident  
- Neha Desai – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, moderately confident  
- Madhura Gowda – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, intuitive user  
- Navneet Kaur – Undergraduate, Political Science, new to health apps  

### 2.4 Method (Test Design)  
Participants added a new habit and marked one session as done.

### 2.5 Task List  
Add a habit (e.g., “Drink water”), set duration, and mark it complete.

### 2.6 Test Environment  
Chrome browser on laptop in quiet environment.

### 2.7 Test Monitor Role  
Observe without intervention unless completely stuck.

### 2.8 Evaluation Measures

| Test/use case   | % completed | errors                      | comments                        |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Habit Tracking  | 80%         | Neha couldn’t mark as done   | Button visibility could improve |

### 2.9 Report Content and Presentation  
Users were mostly successful in adding and completing habits, but Neha couldn’t clearly identify the “mark as done” button, which delayed her task. This indicates the button isn’t explicit or visually emphasized. To address this, we recommend making the button more prominent — use a clear label like “Mark as Done” instead of an icon alone, increase its size, and position it closer to the habit name. You could also highlight it with a bold color and tooltip to guide first-time users.

# **3. Usability Test Plan – Personal Health Tracker**

### 3.1 Purpose  
Test if users can interpret their current progress (streaks, completed habits) clearly.

### 3.2 Problem Statement and Objectives  
New users may not understand the streak indicator or how data is summarized. This test confirms if the visuals are effective.

### 3.3 User Profile  
- Soundarya Srinivas – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, tech-comfortable  
- Sani Hasan – Graduate, Robotics & CS, very confident  
- Neha Desai – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, moderately confident  
- Madhura Gowda – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, intuitive user  
- Navneet Kaur – Undergraduate, Political Science, new to health apps  

### 3.4 Method (Test Design)  
Participants opened the tracker page and described what they saw.

### 3.5 Task List  
Navigate to progress tracker and view streaks and missed habits.

### 3.6 Test Environment  
Chrome browser on laptop in quiet environment.

### 3.7 Test Monitor Role  
Observe quietly; step in only if needed.

### 3.8 Evaluation Measures

| Test/use case      | % completed | errors                        | comments                    |
|--------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Health Tracker     | 90%         | Navneet misunderstood streaks| Needs clearer streak icon   |

### 3.9 Report Content and Presentation  
Most users could interpret their progress correctly, but Navneet misread the streak icons and seemed unsure how it worked. Since she's new to wellness apps, this points to a learning curve. To fix this, we suggest updating the streak icon with a clearer label and adding a short, tappable info icon that explains it. Clear visual mapping between daily activity and streak length would also help.

# **4. Usability Test Plan – Calendar**

### 4.1 Purpose  
Check if users can navigate the calendar and view weekly progress.

### 4.2 Problem Statement and Objectives  
If navigation or weekly view is unclear, users may not track habits effectively.

### 4.3 User Profile  
- Soundarya Srinivas – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, tech-comfortable  
- Sani Hasan – Graduate, Robotics & CS, very confident  
- Neha Desai – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, moderately confident  
- Madhura Gowda – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, intuitive user  
- Navneet Kaur – Undergraduate, Political Science, new to health apps  

### 4.4 Method (Test Design)  
Participants opened the calendar and reviewed habit completion over the past 3 days.

### 4.5 Task List  
View calendar, interpret color-coded days, and understand the weekly overview.

### 4.6 Test Environment  
Chrome browser on laptop in quiet environment.

### 4.7 Test Monitor Role  
Observe quietly; note if users miss color meanings or data indicators.

### 4.8 Evaluation Measures

| Test/use case | % completed | errors | comments                      |
|---------------|-------------|--------|-------------------------------|
| Calendar      | 100%        | None   | All users navigated successfully |

### 4.9 Report Content and Presentation  
All users successfully accessed and interpreted the calendar view, including the color-coded indicators. This suggests the layout is effective and visually accessible. However, to further reduce any potential confusion, a persistent legend explaining what green, yellow, and red mean could be added at the top or as a hover tip. Keeping that visible would improve first-time use clarity even more.

# **5. Usability Test Plan – Wellnest Circle, Challenge & Leaderboard**

### 5.1 Purpose  
To check whether users can create a wellnest circle and add a challenge, and understand the leaderboard.

### 5.2 Problem Statement and Objectives  
Some users may not understand how to join a wellnest circle with a challenge, or create a wellnest circle with their own challenge. This test explores comprehension and flow.

### 5.3 User Profile  
- Soundarya Srinivas – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, tech-comfortable  
- Sani Hasan – Graduate, Robotics & CS, very confident  
- Neha Desai – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, moderately confident  
- Madhura Gowda – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, intuitive user  
- Navneet Kaur – Undergraduate, Political Science, new to health apps  

### 5.4 Method (Test Design)  
Participants were asked to join a wellnest circle or create their own circle with a challenge and then navigate to the leaderboard.

### 5.5 Task List  
Create a new circle with a challenge (e.g., “walk daily”), join a circle and view leaderboard ranking.

### 5.6 Test Environment  
Chrome browser on laptop in quiet environment.

### 5.7 Test Monitor Role  
Observe, note if user completes task smoothly or asks for help.

### 5.8 Evaluation Measures

| Test/use case | % completed | errors                       | comments                   |
|---------------|-------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Challenge     | 90%         | Navneet needed help creating | Better labeling may help   |

### 5.9 Report Content and Presentation  
Most users successfully created or joined a Wellnest Circle with a challenge and viewed the leaderboard. One user hesitated due to unclear button labeling. Updating the button text to better reflect its function (e.g., “Join/Create Challenge”) and adding a short tooltip could improve clarity and task completion for new users.
