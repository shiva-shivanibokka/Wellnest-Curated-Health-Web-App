## Usability Test Plan

# **1. Usability Test Plan – Onboarding Survey**

### 1.1 Purpose

To evaluate how intuitive and easy it is for users to complete the onboarding survey and whether the flow sets up their experience effectively.

### 1.2 Problem Statement and Objectives

Some users may skip the onboarding survey or not find it helpful. This test checks how comfortably users move through the survey and if the content feels relevant.

### 1.3 User Profile

- Soundarya Srinivas – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, tech-comfortable
- Sani Hasan – Graduate, Robotics & CS, very confident
- Neha Desai – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, moderately confident
- Madhura Gowda – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, intuitive user
- Navneet Kaur – Undergraduate, Political Science, new to health apps

### 1.4 Method (Test Design)

Participants were asked to complete the onboarding survey upon opening the app. They were observed for any hesitation, skipped content, or confusion.

### 1.5 Task List

Complete the onboarding survey by responding to the presented questions.

### 1.6 Test Environment

All users accessed the app on a laptop with Google Chrome in a quiet environment.

### 1.7 Test Monitor Role

Observe behavior, note areas of hesitation, and offer help only when users are completely stuck.

### 1.8 Evaluation Measures

| Test/use case | % completed | errors               | comments                           |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Onboarding    | 100%        | Neha skipped halfway | Completed by all except Neha fully |

### 1.9 Report Content and Presentation

Most users completed the onboarding smoothly, indicating the survey flow is intuitive. However, Neha skipped midway, which may suggest fatigue or lack of relevance in the questions. To improve engagement, we recommend breaking the survey into fewer, more dynamic sections and showing a progress bar to help users stay oriented. Adding a short intro on why the survey matters might also improve completion.

# **2. Usability Test Plan – Habit Tracking**

### 2.1 Purpose

Evaluate how easily users can add, update, and mark a habit as complete.

### 2.2 Problem Statement and Objectives

Users should be able to create and track habits effortlessly. This test identifies if button visibility or flow causes friction.

### 2.3 User Profile

- Soundarya Srinivas – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, tech-comfortable
- Sani Hasan – Graduate, Robotics & CS, very confident
- Neha Desai – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, moderately confident
- Madhura Gowda – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, intuitive user
- Navneet Kaur – Undergraduate, Political Science, new to health apps

### 2.4 Method (Test Design)

Participants added a new habit and marked one session as done.

### 2.5 Task List

Add a habit (e.g., “Drink water”), set duration, and mark it complete.

### 2.6 Test Environment

Chrome browser on laptop in quiet environment.

### 2.7 Test Monitor Role

Observe without intervention unless completely stuck.

### 2.8 Evaluation Measures

| Test/use case  | % completed | errors                     | comments                        |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Habit Tracking | 80%         | Neha couldn’t mark as done | Button visibility could improve |

### 2.9 Report Content and Presentation

Users were mostly successful in adding and completing habits, but Neha couldn’t clearly identify the “mark as done” button, which delayed her task. This indicates the button isn’t explicit or visually emphasized. To address this, we recommend making the button more prominent — use a clear label like “Mark as Done” instead of an icon alone, increase its size, and position it closer to the habit name. You could also highlight it with a bold color and tooltip to guide first-time users.

# **3. Usability Test Plan – Personal Health Tracker**

### 3.1 Purpose

Test if users can interpret their current progress (streaks, completed habits) clearly.

### 3.2 Problem Statement and Objectives

New users may not understand the streak indicator or how data is summarized. This test confirms if the visuals are effective.

### 3.3 User Profile

- Soundarya Srinivas – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, tech-comfortable
- Sani Hasan – Graduate, Robotics & CS, very confident
- Neha Desai – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, moderately confident
- Madhura Gowda – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, intuitive user
- Navneet Kaur – Undergraduate, Political Science, new to health apps

### 3.4 Method (Test Design)

Participants opened the tracker page and described what they saw.

### 3.5 Task List

Navigate to progress tracker and view streaks and missed habits.

### 3.6 Test Environment

Chrome browser on laptop in quiet environment.

### 3.7 Test Monitor Role

Observe quietly; step in only if needed.

### 3.8 Evaluation Measures

| Test/use case  | % completed | errors                        | comments                  |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Health Tracker | 90%         | Navneet misunderstood streaks | Needs clearer streak icon |

### 3.9 Report Content and Presentation

Most users could interpret their progress correctly, but Navneet misread the streak icons and seemed unsure how it worked. Since she's new to wellness apps, this points to a learning curve. To fix this, we suggest updating the streak icon with a clearer label and adding a short, tappable info icon that explains it. Clear visual mapping between daily activity and streak length would also help.

---

# **4. Usability Test Plan – Calendar**

### 4.1 Purpose

Check if users can navigate the calendar and view weekly progress.

### 4.2 Problem Statement and Objectives

If navigation or weekly view is unclear, users may not track habits effectively.

### 4.3 User Profile

- Soundarya Srinivas – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, tech-comfortable
- Sani Hasan – Graduate, Robotics & CS, very confident
- Neha Desai – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, moderately confident
- Madhura Gowda – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, intuitive user
- Navneet Kaur – Undergraduate, Political Science, new to health apps

### 4.4 Method (Test Design)

Participants opened the calendar and reviewed habit completion over the past 3 days.

### 4.5 Task List

View calendar, interpret color-coded days, and understand the weekly overview.

### 4.6 Test Environment

Chrome browser on laptop in quiet environment.

### 4.7 Test Monitor Role

Observe quietly; note if users miss color meanings or data indicators.

### 4.8 Evaluation Measures

| Test/use case | % completed | errors | comments                         |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------ | -------------------------------- |
| Calendar      | 100%        | None   | All users navigated successfully |

### 4.9 Report Content and Presentation

All users successfully accessed and interpreted the calendar view, including the color-coded indicators. This suggests the layout is effective and visually accessible. However, to further reduce any potential confusion, a persistent legend explaining what green, yellow, and red mean could be added at the top or as a hover tip. Keeping that visible would improve first-time use clarity even more.

---

# **5. Usability Test Plan – Wellnest Circle, Challenge & Leaderboard**

### 5.1 Purpose

To check whether users can create a wellnest circle and add a challenge, and understand the leaderboard.

### 5.2 Problem Statement and Objectives

Some users may not understand how to join a wellnest circle with a challenge, or create a wellnest circle with their own challenge. This test explores comprehension and flow.

### 5.3 User Profile

- Soundarya Srinivas – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, tech-comfortable
- Sani Hasan – Graduate, Robotics & CS, very confident
- Neha Desai – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, moderately confident
- Madhura Gowda – Graduate, Electrical Engineering, intuitive user
- Navneet Kaur – Undergraduate, Political Science, new to health apps

### 5.4 Method (Test Design)

Participants were asked to join a wellnest circle or create their own circle with a challenge and then navigate to the leaderboard.

### 5.5 Task List

Create a new circle with a challenge (e.g., “walk daily”), join a circle and view leaderboard ranking.

### 5.6 Test Environment

Chrome browser on laptop in quiet environment.

### 5.7 Test Monitor Role

Observe, note if user completes task smoothly or asks for help.

### 5.8 Evaluation Measures

| Test/use case | % completed | errors                       | comments                 |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Challenge     | 90%         | Navneet needed help creating | Better labeling may help |

### 5.9 Report Content and Presentation

Most users successfully created or joined a Wellnest Circle with a challenge and viewed the leaderboard. One user hesitated due to unclear button labeling. Updating the button text to better reflect its function (e.g., “Join/Create Challenge”) and adding a short tooltip could improve clarity and task completion for new users.

## QA Test Plan

### Test Plan

#### Test Plan: Reliability – Habit Logging & Data Consistency

**1. Test Objectives**

- To verify that habit log entries are saved consistently across multiple submissions.
- To ensure that progress graphs are accurately updated based on log data.
- Not testing: error handling for invalid input, UI/UX response time.

**2. Hardware Setup**

- Test machine: MacBook Pro M1 + AWS EC2 (Ubuntu 24.04)
- Memory: 8 GB
- Network: stable Wi-Fi (800+ Mbps)

**3. Software Setup & Initial State**

- OS: macOS 13.5
- Browsers: Chrome 115+, Firefox 115+
- Application backend running on Django (via Gunicorn)
- Logged-in user with at least 1 recurring habit created before test

**4. Test Environment & Human Resources**

- Environment: EC2-hosted deployment with MySQL database
- Test accounts: 1 dummy user account
- Human resources: 1 tester, approx. 25 min total for all test cases

**5. Risks & Contingencies**

- Risk: Data may be lost if database crashes — mitigated by using persistent EC2 volume and version control
- Contingency: If Gunicorn fails during test, restart manually and re-execute affected test only

**6. End Report Format**

- Pass/Fail results in markdown table (see QA Test Table)
- Logged timestamps in browser console + Postman

**7. Test Sequence**

- Input: Submit 10 identical habit logs via UI
- Expected Output: 10 entries visible in progress graph and /api/logs
- Additional Input: Refresh page after each log
- Expected Output: No loss of data or UI reset

#### Test Plan: Cross Browser Compatibility – Progress Page Rendering

**1. Test Objectives**

- To confirm that the `/progress` page UI (graphs and layout) renders consistently across supported browsers.
- Focused on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on macOS and Windows.
- Not testing mobile responsiveness, screen reader compatibility, or performance benchmarking.

**2. Hardware Setup**

- Devices used:
  - MacBook Pro M1
  - Windows 10 PC
- Network: stable Wi-Fi (800+ Mbps)

**3. Software Setup & Initial State**

- Browsers tested:
  - Chrome v115
  - Firefox v115
  - Safari v16
- Local storage cleared before each test to avoid caching issues

**4. Test Environment & Human Resources**

- Environment: Live production deployment on AWS EC2
- Tester: 1 person using both Mac and PC
- Estimated time: 20 minutes to test on 3 browsers (including load and visual checks)

**5. Risks & Contingencies**

- Risk: Cached scripts causing rendering inconsistencies — mitigated with hard refreshes (`Ctrl+Shift+R`)
- Risk: Graphs dependent on backend — if backend is down, frontend test is rescheduled
- Contingency: Use browser devtools to simulate fallback rendering in case of load failure

**6. End Report Format**

- Pass/fail status in markdown test table (see QA section)

**7. Test Sequence**

- Input: Load website in each browser
- Expected Output:
  - Graphs visible
  - Labels readable
  - Responsive layout
  - No overflow, missing axes, or JS errors in console

#### Test Plan: Security – Authentication and Access Control

**1. Test Objectives**

- To validate that the system protects against common authentication vulnerabilities:
  - SQL injection in login form
  - Tampered or invalid auth tokens
  - Expired sessions
- Not testing: HTTPS, brute force login rate limiting, or 2FA

**2. Hardware Setup**

- Local device: MacBook Pro M1
- Remote host: EC2 Ubuntu 24.04 instance
- Network: Secure Wi-Fi (password protected)

**3. Software Setup & Initial State**

- Backend: Django running on Gunicorn, connected to MySQL
- Frontend hosted on Nginx
- Test account already created in DB
- Browser: Firefox v115 + DevTools
- Tools used:
  - Postman for custom request crafting
  - Firefox cookie editor to modify tokens

**4. Test Environment & Human Resources**

- Test scope: Live server over HTTP
- Tester: 1 person
- Estimated time: 15–20 minutes
- Backup: SQL dump of DB taken before test in case of data corruption

**5. Risks & Contingencies**

- Risk: Temporary lockout from session error, mitigated by keeping backup token in cookie editor
- Risk: Server crash from bad input — test only on test account
- Contingency: If Django error page shown, log full traceback from browser/dev server logs

**6. End Report Format**

- Pass/fail summary in markdown QA test table
- Screenshots of console/cookies used only if test fails

**7. Test Sequence**

- Test 1 Input: `admin' OR 1=1 --` submitted via login form
  - Expected Output: login should fail, no backend error exposed
- Test 2 Input: Manually modify auth token to invalid string
  - Expected Output: 401 Unauthorized and redirect to login page
- Test 3 Input: Wait 60+ minutes after login and try to access `/log-habit`
  - Expected Output: session expired → redirect to login

#### Test Plan: Usability – Navigation and Clarity

**1. Test Objectives**

- To assess whether key navigation elements (homepage CTA, navbar links, form labels) are intuitive and easy to use
- To validate that users can complete key actions without confusion.
- Not testing: visual design polish, detailed UX heuristics, or deep accessibility features.

**2. Hardware Setup**

- Device: MacBook Pro M1
- Network: stable Wi-Fi (800+ Mbps)

**3. Software Setup & Initial State**

- OS: macOS
- Browser: Chrome 115, Firefox 115
- WELLNEST app hosted on EC2 and accessed via public IP
- Test account already logged in
- Application is in default state

**4. Test Environment & Human Resources**

- Environment: Deployed server on EC2
- Tester: 1 internal QA + 1 outside user for observation
- Time estimate: 15 minutes total (3 mini-tests, 5 min each)

**5. Risks & Contingencies**

- Risk: User unfamiliarity may skew usability perception — addressed by short explanation that this is a first-impression usability test
- Risk: Unclear form fields may not result in technical errors but still fail UX wise
- Contingency: Any confusion or missed nav paths documented for future UI updates

**6. End Report Format**

- QA test table contains Pass/Fail
- Qualitative user notes recorded in comments

**7. Test Sequence**

- Test 1 Input: Observe if user can describe what WELLNEST does after reading homepage
  - Expected Output: User should correctly identify habit tracking purpose
- Test 2 Input: Ask user to click “Progress”, “Log Habit”, “About”, “Logout”
  - Expected Output: All nav links reachable without hesitation
- Test 3 Input: Fill out habit form with no guidance
  - Expected Output: User knows where to enter name, value, and description without confusion

#### Test Plan: Accessibility – Keyboard and Feedback

**1. Test Objectives**

- To verify that all key elements (navigation links, form inputs, buttons) are accessible via keyboard alone.
- To ensure that form validation messages are visible and understandable to all users, including those with assistive needs.

**2. Hardware Setup**

- Device: MacBook Pro M1
- Keyboard-only input used (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter)
- No mouse/touchpad interactions during test

**3. Software Setup & Initial State**

- OS: macOS
- Browsers: Chrome 115 and Firefox 115
- WELLNEST app hosted on AWS EC2 and accessed via browser
- User logged in with existing habit data for meaningful interaction
- Form reset and all elements visible at start

**4. Test Environment & Human Resources**

- Environment: Production-deployed version
- Tester: 1 person using keyboard-only mode
- Time required: ~10 minutes to complete 3 tests
- Accessibility tooling (VoiceOver or Chrome DevTools Accessibility pane) optionally available for verification

**5. Risks & Contingencies**

- Risk: Focus outline may be missing due to custom CSS (`outline: none`) — failure condition
- Risk: Error messages may appear without ARIA live regions — flagged for future update but not auto-fail
- Contingency: If Tab skips focusable elements, test is marked as Fail and element ID is documented

**6. End Report Format**

- Result summary in markdown QA table
- Notes logged on any skipped or inaccessible fields

**7. Test Sequence**

- Test 1 Input: Press Tab key to move across nav, inputs, buttons
  - Expected Output: Each element receives a visible focus indicator
- Test 2 Input: Submit empty habit form (e.g., no habit name/value)
  - Expected Output: Native HTML5 validation triggers a message near field
- Test 3 Input: Observe field borders and styling during navigation
  - Expected Output: All form fields and buttons show clear active focus

## Localization Testing

### Localization Plan

The WELLNEST application was evaluated for localization readiness across two language-region pairs:

- **en-US → es-MX (English to Mexican Spanish)**
- **en-US → en-GB (U.S. to British English)**

The goal was to verify that the application's text content, UI labels, and formatting adapt properly to different languages, cultural expressions, and regional conventions. The test focused on three core components:

1. Homepage tagline
2. Navigation bar
3. Log Habit form

Testing was conducted by manually switching UI text and labels using browser devtools and inspecting how well the layout and messages adapted to different translations and regions.

### Test Cases

| Test # | Feature          | Region/Language | Task                                             | Expected Output                                                              | Result |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1      | Homepage tagline | en-US → es-MX   | Replace tagline text with Spanish neutral phrase | “Track your habits” → “Sigue tus hábitos” fits and conveys same meaning      | PASS   |
| 2      | Navigation bar   | en-US → es-MX   | Translate nav items to Spanish                   | “Progress” → “Progreso”, “About” → “Acerca de” all fit and read naturally    | PASS   |
| 3      | Log Habit form   | en-US → es-MX   | Translate form labels and placeholders           | “Habit Name” → “Nombre del hábito”, “Value” → “Valor” appear clearly         | FAIL   |
| 4      | Homepage tagline | en-US → en-GB   | Reword CTA to use British tone/spelling          | “Track your habits” → “Keep track of your habits” fits UK tone               | FAIL   |
| 5      | Date Format      | en-US → en-GB   | Change date display format                       | “July 30, 2025” → “30 July 2025” on progress entries                         | PASS   |
| 6      | Units / Terms    | en-US → en-GB   | Update measurements and terminology              | “Sleep (hours)” remains same, but “Color” → “Colour” in UI (when applicable) | FAIL   |

### Results

Out of 6 test cases, only 3 passed. Spanish navigation labels and the homepage tagline adapted correctly to the `es-MX` locale. However, other elements did not update as expected due to hardcoded English text or lack of locale awareness in the UI.

## Code Review

### Coding Standards

The practices that our team has been following through the entirety of this project has been to utilize previous documentation and diagrams created to provide uniformity in naming conventions and direction when it comes to having a function complete it's goal. Regular review of the code created and submitted is performed by the GitMaster and Team Lead to promote working and efficient code that can be iterated on successfully and without further conflict. Regular use of comments within the code base and on GitHub has allowed easy understanding of the purpose of code and commits as review and error tracing is performed. Another key piece of organization was the use of multiple feature branches as needed so that team members had a way of segmenting their work and not impacting others.

### Internal Code Review

For the Internal Code Review, we weren't as consistent with it because we only recently approved pull requests with comments. Within the previous milestones, we would hop onto a voice call with our group lead and approve the pull requests and merges verbally. Unfortunately, there was a miscommunication with this, therefore, we dont have physical comments for approvals. We caught this and realized too late, therefore the screenshots provided were of us approving with comments, or had comments that were later approved and acknowledged in our team chat. Most of our team lead's approval was over the recorded zoom meetings we had as a group where we went over it together.

## Self-Check on Security Practices

### Major Assets

Assets

**User Credentials:** Usernames, passwords, email, personal details like gender and full name.

**Habit & Health Logs:** Data about pre-defined and custom habits

**Social Connections:** Friends, friend requests, circles, and notifications.

**Session Information:** Authenticated user sessions and CSRF protection.

### Password Encryption

Passwords are encrypted using Django’s built-in set_password() method, which applies a salted hash using PBKDF2 by default. On the front end side the password is not visible.

!["Spass"](Files/Spass.jpg)

!["Spass"](Files/pass.jpg)

### Input Validation

In the Habit Creation process, only validated input is passed

!["value"](Files/value.jpg)
!["vPass"](Files/valuepass.jpg)

Similarly, in the search box, empty queries will not trigger to prevent unnecessary API calls

!["Search"](Files/search.jpg)

### CSRF Protection

On most HTMLS and JS files you can find traces of CSRF protection for instance in habit creation
!["CSRF"](Files/CSRF.jpg)

### Session Cookie

Session Cookie age is implemented to log out users after 1 hour of inactivity
!["Cookie"](Files/cookie.jpg)

### OOP Security Practices

By using many classes with small scopes, separated functionalities, and limited exposed fields, we ensure encapsulation

!["encapsulation"](Files/encapsulation.jpg)

### Field Visibility

Using Model Constraints and Field Visibility, we ensure data encapsulation.
Password is write-only to limit exposure

!["passwordencription"](Files/passenc.jpg)

### Abstraction and Inheritance

Using Abstraction and Inheritance from the Django library, we ensure user data safety when creating an account
!["userc"](Files/userC.jpg)

### Decorators

We limited access using decorators, such as @isAuthenticated and @login_required

!["decorate"](Files/decorate.jpg)

### Database Logic

Using a consistent order for our Friends model, we avoid duplicated and conflicting relations

!["databaselogic"](Files/databaselogic.jpg)
