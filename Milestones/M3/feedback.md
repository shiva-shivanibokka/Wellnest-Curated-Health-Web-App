# M3v1 Feedback and Prototype Grading

This team has shown noticeable improvement in this milestone, and I appreciate the progress. That said, there are still a few major areas that need attention:

- Not following instructions in the README files
- Repeating mistakes from previous milestones
- Focusing on non-essential matters, such as internal score disagreements

A quick note about scores: I don’t use them directly for grading. They serve as a reference for my notes. When scores align with my observations, I don't need to investigate further. However, when there’s a mismatch, I’ll look into it more closely.

My advice is to focus on what truly matters:
- Pay closer attention to the instructions provided
- Address the core issues in your GitHub organization and project structure

You're making good progress, stay focused and keep going!

**Prototype Grade:** 5/7  
**Grade for GitHub Organization:** –2 points (to be deducted from the final milestone grade after reviewing your M3v2 documentation at the end of the semester)

Keep up the good work and stay focused on the essentials, you’ve got this!

## Checkpoint 1

### Prioritized High-Level Functional Requirements

- **Minor Issues:**
  - Entities must be enumerated (e.g., `1. Registered User`). Requirements within an entity should follow hierarchical numbering (e.g., `1.1`, `1.2`). This improves traceability.
  - The actor initiating the action in a requirement should be the corresponding entity. For example:
    ```
    3. Personal Health Tracker  
       3.1 A personal health tracker shall track the number of consecutive habit sessions from the user.
    ```
    Avoid using `User` as the actor for all requirements unless it truly reflects the initiating entity.

- **Major Issue:**
  - This is the final time I’ll provide this feedback: you were previously asked in M2v1 to revise your prioritization and move P3 requirements up to P2 or P1, where appropriate. This change was not made in M2v2 or M3v1.
  - P3 should contain only 3–4 requirements that are truly opportunistic and complex. For instance, `Users shall be able to rate the survey` is not a P3—it should be P1 or P2.
  - Please update your prioritization and create new, clearly opportunistic P3 requirements.

### Remaining Sections

- The rest of the documentation looks solid.
- In the scalability section, I was expecting a stronger visual component (a diagram would help), but the written explanation is clear and well thought out.

## Checkpoint 2

- I tested one use case, and it worked very well—great job!
- However, as mentioned in class, there are significant UI/UX issues that must be addressed in your beta prototype. Please refer to the class recording or the AI companion summary for more details.

## Checkpoint 3

- **Credentials Folder:**
  - As emphasized in class and lectures, this folder is critical for the CTO.
  - You're missing the following required components:
    - Security Guidelines
    - Contact Information
    - A tutorial or set of instructions for SSH access to your database instance
