## Post-Analysis: Lessons Learned

Over the course of this milestone our team has encountered many challenges and was able to overcome many of them. Some of the challenges ranged from understanding new technologies, communication between the whole team, misunderstanding role responsibilities, and more. As we progressed through all of the milestones we eventually were able to remedy some of these challenges.

One of the biggest challenges that faced our team was lack of organization on multiple fronts. Initially members were performing roles that were not assigned to them, which caused confusion and rework for some members. This was remedied by having a conversation about what the responsibilities of each role was and how the role cold be fulfilled. Another point of disorganization was not following all of the instructions in the milestone reademe.md. This caused our team unnecessary loss of points. To remedy this, I had created an assignment tracker that gave each member of the team an assignment based off the readme and associated roles. This vastly improved our organization, and we were able to make big strides in our progress. Another guideline I had implemented was making sure my team was constantly updating the chat room. It felt necessary to me that the team was constantly letting everyone know what they were working on and when they had completed their assigned task. This was crucial in keeping general awareness throughout the team as well as providing an extra layer of organization.

Above all attention to detail and communication is paramount. There is no such thing as asking too many questions or overcommunicating. Our team was the strongest when the chat was active and team meetings were long. Everyone would walk away with clarity in those moments. Those who asked the most questions and really took ownership of this project had seen the most success and I hope they take those skills with them moving forward.

Some takeaways are that trust is extremely important as there are so many tasks to juggle in project like this that missed details have strong repercussions. You have to be able to trust that your team is going to show up and do the job they were assigned or face letting down your team. Lack of effort by one person is felt by everyone. With that trust also comes sharing information about your progress and/or struggles so that your team can be there for you. Any instance of not sharing information can hinder the team, cause waste of time, or hard feelings. 

Last but not least there will be times of strong emotions. Those emotions need to be expressed through constructive criticisms and not put downs of others. Nobody is perfect and there will always be mistakes, but as a team you have to get through those mistakes *together*.

Moving forward, if we were to do another project together, I would love to see more sense of ownnership, stronger communication, more questions be asked, and an open mind when criticisms are recieved. The corporate environment wont be as forgiving as the classroom.

Always remember, what you give is what you get.
