## <mark style="color:blue;">Executive Summary</mark>

In today's society, where sedentary lifestyles and inconsistent routines increasingly compromise every individual’s physical and mental health, there’s a need for a solution to combat this. This is where our product would come into play: Wellnest, a socially driven mobile application that assists users in monitoring healthy habits and setting and achieving personal wellness goals, resulting in a more balanced life.

Our product, Wellnest, offers a complete hub in which users can track their healthy habits. Unlike other apps in the market that mainly focus on more narrow metrics like steps and calories, Wellnest enables users to log and manage a wide range of their habits. Some examples of the features would be to track food and water intake, weekly sleep patterns, physical activity, and more specific habits like smoking and alcohol intake. The app will essentially take all this data and generate a personalized dashboard catering to the individual user to monitor the trends and track their progress over time.

A key feature that Wellnest offers is its “Wellness Circle”, enabling users to connect with friends and family within a competitive environment to the health challenges. These challenges would consist of hydration goals, daily steps, sleeping habits, etc. This social component will transform health tracking into a more engaging environment shared with other users, creating an incentive to stick to a routine to stay ahead.

On top of the manual tracking feature available, Wellnest will utilize AI-powered insights and behavioral nudges to remind users to stay on track. Essentially, Wellnest will include smart reminders, adaptive suggestions, and milestone celebrations to make the app feel less like a tracker, but a personal digital trainer. This is designed to maintain engagement and to consistently encourage long-term behavioral change.

With the user’s personal experience in mind, we aim to build this with scalability to support future architecture and expansions of Wellnest. From integration with wearable devices, mood tracking, to mindfulness modules, this would allow us as the developers of the app to understand our users’ experience to decide what features are working and which are not. The app itself also prioritizes data privacy, utilizing secure protocols to ensure the protection of user information not being compromised.

When taking a look from a technical standpoint, our goal is to develop a platform that is not just robust and secure, but rather impactful to each user. We believe that Wellnest fills a critical gap in today’s market by encompassing the idea of an all-in-one health companion. This promotes consistency, self-awareness, and community, which are essentially the key pillars of an ideal healthy lifestyle to incorporate in a user’s day-to-day. By combining aspects of a thoughtful design, smart technology, and a deep understanding of user motivation, Wellnest aims to become more than just an app lost in your app library, but a companion for self-growth.

### Use Cases:

#### **#1\. Signing Up and Setting Up Health Goals**

**Actor:** Rhea (Graduate Student)

**Assumptions:** Rhea has a smartphone and internet access

**Use Case:**

Rhea is a full-time student who struggles with staying hydrated and getting consistent sleep. After hearing about Wellnest from a classmate, she installs the app on her phone. She taps on "Sign Up," creates an account, and selects hydration and sleep as her focus areas. She sets a target of 2 liters of water daily and at least 7 hours of sleep each night. The app offers her gentle reminders and invites her to join a 30-Day Sleep Challenge with other students, which she accepts.

**Benefits:**

- Helps Rhea stay properly hydrated by reminding her throughout the day, which is especially helpful when she’s busy with classes

- Encourages her to prioritize sleep by setting realistic, consistent targets and tracking her progress.

- Keeps her accountable through social challenges and gentle nudges without overwhelming her.

- Builds a healthy routine gradually, making it easier to stick with over time

#### **2\. Logging and Reducing Smoking/Alcohol Habits**

**Actor:** Devon (Tech Professional)

**Assumptions:** Devon wants to cut back on cigarettes and on social as well as personal drinking habits.

**Use case:**

Devon is a 32-year-old software developer who has been a chain smoker for years and tends to drink regularly — both during and after work, and during social events. He’s aware that these habits are affecting his health, but hasn’t been able to track or reduce them consistently. On the suggestion of a colleague, he installs Wellnest and starts logging every cigarette and alcoholic drink.

After two weeks of tracking, the app shows him a pattern: his smoking peaks during late-night work and alcohol intake is highest on weekends. It then suggests a personalized Evening Swap Plan, offering alternative substitutes like chamomile tea, music, or short breathing exercises. Devon enables the plan and starts receiving gentle nudges at his usual smoking and drinking times. Over the next month, he begins to log fewer instances, and the app acknowledges his progress with supportive messages and weekly summaries.

**Benefits:**

- Helps Devon clearly see when and why he smokes or drinks

- Offers practical, non-judgmental alternatives based on his lifestyle

- Reinforces progress with positive feedback instead of guilt

- Keeps him engaged with simple daily choices that add up to meaningful change over time

![Devon.png](images/Devon.png)

#### **3\. Identifying Junk Food Patterns and Suggesting Alternatives**

**Actor:** Mary (Homemaker)

**Assumption:** Mary wants to eat healthier but tends to stress-eat when overwhelmed

**Use Case:**

Mary, a full-time homemaker, often finds herself reaching for chips, cookies, or processed meals during moments of stress or exhaustion. She decides to try Wellnest to log her meals and gain more control over her eating habits. After a week of consistent logging, the app identifies a pattern of high-calorie, high-sodium foods, especially in the afternoons and evenings. It notifies her and offers healthier, quick-prep snack alternatives like hummus with veggies or Greek yogurt with fruit.

Mary enables Smart Substitution Alerts, which offer better choices in real-time when she logs similar processed items. Although she occasionally returns to her old patterns, she becomes more conscious of what she’s eating. Even when she indulges, she logs it honestly — and the app responds with encouragement, not guilt. Over time, Mary develops a more balanced relationship with food, choosing healthier options more frequently and understanding her triggers better.

**Benefits:**

- Builds real awareness around stress-eating habits and food choices

- Provides helpful and realistic alternatives that fit her daily routine.

- Encourages consistency without guilt, even when setbacks happen

- Supports long-term habit change by helping Mary understand and manage her triggers

#### **4\. Weekly Insight and Adjustment**

**Actor:** Jenny (Corporate Manager)

**Assumptions:** Jenny regularly logs caffeine intake and sleep patterns using a health app

**Use Case:**

Jenny is a high-performing professional who works long hours, often late into the night. To keep up, she relies heavily on caffeine — mostly through coffee but sometimes energy drinks as well. Her average sleep time is under 4 hours, even on weekends. She begins using Wellnest to track her daily caffeine consumption and sleep duration.

After a week of data collection, Wellnest identifies that her late-night caffeine intake is severely impacting her sleep. It suggests a “Caffeine Curfew” and prompts her to shift to non-caffeinated drinks in the evening. Jenny enables this feature and receives gentle reminders to wind down. Over time, the app helps her replace evening coffee with herbal teas, and her sleep duration gradually increases. The weekly report shows clear improvement, and the consistent nudges keep her motivated to continue making better choices.

**Benefits:**

- Makes the connection between caffeine intake and sleep disruption clear and easy to understand.

- Provides personalized, manageable steps without overwhelming the user

- Reinforces small improvements through weekly reports and visible progress

- Helps Jenny begin a gradual but meaningful shift toward healthier routines despite her demanding lifestyle

![Jenny.png](images/Jenny.png)

#### **5\. Social Motivation Through Challenges**

**Actor:** Arnold (College Athlete)

**Assumption:** Arnold enjoys competition and is highly conscious of his health and fitness routine

**Use Case:**

Arnold is a state-level athlete who maintains a strict diet and workout routine. While he tries to avoid unhealthy food and drinks, he often finds himself tempted by sodas and the occasional fast food. His trainer has encouraged him to completely cut out sodas and replace them with protein drinks to stay competition-ready.

Arnold uses Wellnest to track his daily food and beverage intake. He signs up for the “No Soda for 7 Days” challenge through the Wellness Circle. On the third day, he logs a soda out of habit. Instead of disqualifying him, the app suggests a recovery activity — a 20-minute high-intensity workout. He completes the task and continues the challenge. Over the course of the week, Arnold becomes more mindful of his beverage choices, and the support from his wellness circle helps him stay on track.

**Benefits:**

- Helps athletes like Arnold build discipline by reinforcing long-term goals through short, manageable challenges

- Turns slip-ups into learning opportunities rather than setbacks.

- Keeps motivation high with encouragement and achievement badges

- Promotes consistency and mindfulness, which are crucial for athletes working to improve performance and health habits

With the above table, it becomes evident that while most competing health apps offer selective features like food logging, sleep tracking, or wearable syncing, they often operate in silos and lack a unified, user-centric approach. Additionally, several apps place essential features like habit insights or social engagement behind premium subscriptions, limiting accessibility for many users. Wellnest fills this gap by offering a holistic platform that combines core habit tracking (food, sleep, hydration, exercise) with often-overlooked aspects like mood logging and smoking/alcohol control. What sets Wellnest apart is its use of AI to provide personalized nudges, adaptive suggestions, and wellness insights — all without overwhelming the user. The inclusion of a "Wellness Circle" introduces a community-driven model where users can challenge, support, and grow with one another. Moreover, while full wearable integration is on the roadmap, Wellnest ensures that users can gain value even without external devices, making it both inclusive and scalable. In essence, Wellnest isn't just another health tracker — it is a smart, supportive companion that promotes sustainable lifestyle change through personalization, empathy, and social accountability. These differentiators position Wellnest uniquely in a crowded market and make it a promising alternative to traditional wellness apps.

## Data Definitions

**1. User**

- Users are the people who interact with the app. Each person has a profile that includes their username, first and last name, email, gender, and a securely encrypted password. The system also tracks the date the user joined (`created_at`). Users can create custom habits and participate in wellness circles. 

**2. Habit**

- This is an abstract table that serves as the general structure for all habits. It does not store any attributes itself but acts as a parent to both `Custom_Habit` and `Defined_Habit`. Its purpose is to provide a unified structure for different types of habits that can be tracked in the system.

**3. Custom_Habit**

- Custom habits are routines defined by users themselves. Each habit includes a descriptive name, the value recorded (like “2L” for water or “30 mins” for a workout), and the timestamp of when it was recorded. Every custom habit is tied to the `user_id` of the person who created it. This model directly inherits from the abstract Habit class.

**4. Defined_Habit**

- Defined habits are preconfigured routines that come built into the app, such as “Drink Water” or “Morning Walk.” These habits inherit from the abstract Habit entity and do not contain any additional attributes. They offer users a quick-start option and promote uniformity across wellness circles.

**5. Wellnest_Circle**

- A Wellnest Circle is a group created to support shared health goals. Each group can have only one goal assigned to it. Users can join multiple wellness circles—either by creating one themselves or by joining a group started by another user.

**6. Joins**

- This is an associative entity that links users to wellness circles. Since users can belong to many groups and groups can have many users, this table handles the many-to-many relationship cleanly.

**7. Leaderboard**

- The leaderboard keeps track of each user’s score within a specific wellness circle. It records the total score for each user, the group it belongs to, and the last time the leaderboard was updated. This brings in a sense of progress and healthy competition among users.

**8. Streak**

- Streaks monitor how consistently users stick to a habit. For each user-habit pair, we record the current streak length, the longest streak they've ever had, and when the streak was last updated. It rewards users for forming long-lasting routines.

**9. WaterIntake**

- This table captures daily water consumption. For every log, it stores how much water was consumed (in milliliters), the user’s ID, and the timestamp of the entry.

**10. FoodIntake**

- This tracks what the user eats and when. It records the calorie count, timestamp, and type of meal—whether it’s breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Each entry also ties back to the user who logged it.

**11. SleepLog**

- Sleep logs help track rest. Each entry records the user’s ID, when they fell asleep, when they woke up, and the total number of hours slept. This data helps users monitor sleep patterns over time.

**12. WorkoutLog**

- Workout logs track physical activity. For each session, it stores the user’s ID, how long they exercised, and when it happened. This supports habit tracking around fitness and physical wellbeing.

## UI Mockup and Storyboards

### Rhea Sign-up Scenario

Reah Sign-ins to the Wellnest app after inputting her Username, Email, and Password. In the Main page she sees a calendar, an inspirational quote, and a text from the app welcoming her. She has not created any pre-existing nor custom habits, but she has a notification from a friend who suggested the app to her. She clicks on the notification and navigates to the socials page. She has not added any friends but she can join a wellness circle managed by Jake. After accepting the challenge, she navigates to the challenge page and sees the progress everyone has made towards the challenge, her standing on the leaderboard, and the participants of the challenge in her Wellness circle.

![Sign-up Scenario](images/Signup-Rhea.jpg)

### Creating Habits Scenario

Devon uses the Wellnest app every day. Today, he opened the app and sees that he has 3 habits left to do today: Walking, Reading, and Not Smoking. He wishes to add another custom habit / task. He clicks on the add habit button in the nav bar or under the To Do list and an overlay opens for him to customize a new task. He can choose the task name, description, time, duration, etc. After he is done he will click the Done button, and the overlay will close.

![Devon creating habits](images/Custom-Devon.jpg)

### Habits / Challenges types and pages

Mary opens the Wellnest app and sees three different kinds of tasks/ habits that Wellnest offers:

1. Personal habits that are pre-existing or she has customly created for herself.
1. Group habits that have been created by other people and she has joined.
1. Friendly challenges that only she and her friend are a part of.

She clicks on one of the challenges and navigates to the page of that challenge, viewing the information, statistics, and leaderboard of the challenge.

## High-Level System Design

### 6.1 High Level Database Architecture

**Initial Database Requirements**

Our app's backend database is designed to support a holistic wellness tracking platform. It allows users to log daily health activities such as water intake, food intake, sleep duration, and workouts. Additionally, users can create or join group wellness challenges called “Wellnest Circles,” where progress is tracked and visualized through a leaderboard.
Each user can also define and track personal habits. The system supports both solo and group engagement, with no requirement for users to join a group in order to benefit from the app’s features. A streak system is also maintained to encourage consistency.

The database emphasizes:
-	Time-based logs for accurate trend tracking
-	Normalized structure for scalable and efficient data access
-	Foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity
-	Support for leaderboard logic in a multi-user group setting


**DBMS Selection**

We selected **MySQL**, hosted on an **AWS EC2** instance, as our backend DBMS.

MySQL offers robust support for relational modeling, foreign key enforcement, ACID compliance, and indexing, which are essential for managing user-specific logs and real-time group statistics.
It integrates smoothly with Django ORM, making backend development more efficient and secure.

**Database Organization**

Our database has ten main tables: `User`, `Custom_Habit`, `FoodIntake`, `Joins`, `Leaderboard`, `SleepLog`, `Streak`, `WaterIntake`, `Wellnest_Circle`, and `WorkoutLog`. These tables are connected using foreign keys to keep everything organized and related.  Every log is saved with a timestamp (where necessary) so we can track progress over time in a clear and structured way.


**A. Entities, Attributes, Relationships, and Domains**

- User: Stores personal data and health metrics of each registered user. Acts as the central entity.
- Custom_Habit & Defined_Habit: Support user-defined and pre-defined habits respectively.
- WaterIntake, FoodIntake, WorkoutLog, SleepLog: Time-stamped logs of user health behavior.
- Wellnest_Circle: Represents a group wellness challenge with a name, description, and creation time.
- Leaderboard: Tracks user scores in each group, supporting performance comparisons.
- Streak: Tracks a user's ongoing success in habit consistency.
- Joins: A bridge table linking users to the Wellnest Circles they've joined.

**B. Key relationships:**

- One User can have many logs (1-to-many).
- One User can belong to many Wellnest_Circles (many-to-many via Joins).
- One Leaderboard entry uniquely combines a User and a Wellnest_Circle (unique constraint).
- All logs and relational tables use foreign keys to maintain referential integrity with the User table and others where applicable.

![Database Table](images/DB_table.png)

**ERD Diagram**

An ERD was created using `draw.io` to represent the entities, their attributes, and how they relate. The diagram highlights the key functionalities of the system, such as user logging, group engagement, and progress tracking. Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity and enforce the rules of interaction between different parts of the database.

![ERD_New](images/ERDM2.jpg)

**Media Storage**
- For this project, we do not plan to store or handle any user-uploaded media files such as images, video, audio, or GPS data. Instead, users will be able to select from a set of predefined profile icons. These icons are handled as static assets on the frontend, with only a reference (e.g., file name or ID) stored in the database. This approach keeps the system efficient while still providing basic personalization features.

### Backend Architecture

**Scalability Diagram**

![Scalability Diagram Version 2](images/Scalability_M2_Team03_1.jpg)

**Architecture Summary**

Our backend system is designed with future scalability, modularity, and security in mind, following microservices principles and anticipating production-level deployment needs. The current implementation lays the groundwork for future enhancements including containerization, replication, caching, and more robust load handling.

**A. Microservices Architecture**

- We follow a microservices architecture, where different backend functionalities are separated into independently manageable services:
    -	User Microservice: Responsible for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
    -	Group Microservice: Handles creation and management of user groups.
    -	Future Microservice: Placeholder for upcoming features (e.g., notifications, analytics).

-This design allows us to independently scale, test, and deploy each component as our needs evolve.

**B. Load Balancers (Planned for Future)**

- Although not currently deployed, we plan to integrate Nginx as a reverse proxy and load balancer. In the future, this will:
    -	Distribute traffic evenly across microservice instances,
    -	Enable SSL termination (HTTPS),
    -	Enforce API security via session-based authentication,
    -	Optionally introduce rate limiting for abuse prevention.

- For now, all requests are routed directly from the frontend to services through a basic Nginx proxy layer.

**C. Caching Strategies (Planned for Future)**

- We plan to use Redis for:
    -	Session caching to minimize repeated authentication checks,
    -	Query caching to reduce database load on frequent read operations.

- While Redis is represented in our architecture for planning purposes, it is not yet in active use.

**D. Reliability and Fault Tolerance (Planned with Containers)**

- Currently, our services are deployed directly on an AWS EC2 instance without container orchestration. As we scale, we plan to use Docker containers to enhance reliability and fault tolerance by:
    -	Isolating services to prevent one failure from affecting others,
    -	Enabling automatic restarts of crashed containers,
    -	Supporting horizontal scaling by spinning up additional container instances.

- These improvements will help us make the most of our existing cloud infrastructure and ensure the system can handle higher loads and failures gracefully.

**E. Containers (Planned with CI/CD Pipeline)**

- Although our code is currently deployed manually or with limited automation, we are planning to use Jenkins (running inside a Docker container) to automate builds and deployment:
    -	GitHub → Jenkins (build & test) → Deployment server.
    -	This will enable faster CI/CD workflows and consistent deployments.

**F.Data Replication and Consistency (Planned for Scaling Reads)**

- We plan to adopt a primary-replica database architecture using MySQL:
    -	The primary DB will handle writes,
    -	Read replicas will offload select-heavy operations to boost performance.

- This setup is not yet implemented but is part of our scalability roadmap.

**G. Security Considerations**

- We are currently implementing:
    -	SSL Termination via Nginx,
    -	Session-based authentication to validate API requests.

- We’ve included rate limiting in the architecture diagram as an optional future enhancement to protect the system from misuse. We may also introduce token-based access or API keys for microservice-to-microservice communication when needed.

### UML Diagram

![UML_New](images/UMLDiagram2.jpg)

**placeholder for descriptions 6.2**

### Application Network and Deployment Design

![Application Network & Deployment Diagram](./images/netdep.drawio.png)

This illustrates the network and deployment architecture of our web application hosted on an AWS EC2 (t2.micro) instance running Ubuntu 24.04. All services are deployed directly on the EC2 host. Incoming HTTPS requests (port 443) from users are handled by Nginx, which serves as a reverse proxy and manages SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt. Nginx routes frontend requests to a stat HTML/CSS/JS interface served on port 3000 and backend API traffic to a Django 5.2.3 application running on Gunicorn. All inter service communcation occurs over localhost for added security, with the backend connecting to a MySQL database on port 3306.

### High Level APIs and Main Algorithms

**1. Overall API Architecture**

Our model is designed using a modular, service-oriented backend structure. The backend is divided into microservices such as the User Service and Group Service, each responsible for managing specific core functionalities like user data, group challenges, and habit tracking.

-	User Service APIs include:
    -	Managing user profiles (creation, update, deletion)
    -	Logging health metrics and daily routines (water, food, sleep, workout)
    -	Retrieving personalized user summaries based on activity trends

-	Group Service APIs include:
    -	Creating and managing wellness circles
    -	Allowing users to join and leave groups
    -	Tracking group-based challenges and progress
    -	Maintaining leaderboards for community motivation

This service split ensures scalability and clean code organization

**2. Search Functionality**

- The system supports a user-facing search bar to look up predefined habits and Wellnest Circles. When a user types a keyword, the backend uses fuzzy matching and keyword normalization to retrieve results.
    - Search endpoint example:
        GET /api/search?query=walk
        This returns a list of matching habit names or group titles such as “Morning Walk”, “Walk 5K Steps”.

    -	Search logic:
        -	Normalize text (case-insensitive, trimmed input)
        -	Search predefined habits first
        -	Then search group names from the database using LIKE
        -	Optionally, we can use simple Levenstein distance for fuzzy match improvement if needed

**3. Ranking Algorithm (Leaderboard)**

- Leaderboards track user performance inside each Wellnest Circle and ranks participants based on their progress toward the circle’s goal.

    - Ranking endpoint example:
        GET /api/leaderboard/:circle_id
        This returns users in that group, sorted by their scores in descending order.
        :circle_id  is a dynamic path parameter that should be replaced with the actual ID of the wellness circle that the user wants to look up

    - Ranking logic:
        - Each user’s score is computed when a logged habit aligns with the group's goal
        - Higher consistency and longer streaks earn more points
        - Tiebreakers are resolved by last_updated (more recent activity wins)

**4. Streak Algorithm**

- A streak tracks how many consecutive days a user has completed a specific habit.

    - Tracked using:
        Streak(`user_id`, `habit_id`, `current_streak`, `longest_streak`, `last_updated`)

    - Streak logic:
        - If user logs a habit today → current_streak += 1
        - If yesterday’s log is missing → current_streak = 1
        - longest_streak updates if current_streak exceeds it

- This encourages consistency and builds accountability in habit formation.

**5. Personalized Evaluation Algorithm**

- This algorithm powers the "Your Progress" page in the app, where users can view a daily summary of their health routines.
    - It aggregates daily logs for water, food, sleep, and workout
    - The summary reflects progress toward goals and streak status
    - Users can view their log entries for the current and previous days
    - The data is fetched on demand—no background evaluation or auto-updates

- This feature gives the user a clear and consolidated picture of their daily wellness activities without overwhelming them with detail.

**6. Rating System (Planned Future Enhancement)**

- At this stage of our project, we haven’t implemented a formal rating feature. However, it’s something we’ve identified as a valuable addition for future development.

- For example:
    - Users could rate predefined habits and wellness circles (1–5 stars)
    - These ratings could influence search results or recommendations
    - Community-rated content can improve onboarding for new users

- While it's not part of our current model, we plan to explore this feature to make the experience more interactive and community-driven.

**7.	API Design Philosophy**

- All APIs follow RESTful principles with clean and logical grouping of resources. The backend is structured using Django REST Framework, and endpoints are designed to be reusable, secure, and scalable.
    - All data is validated and sanitized before database entry.
    - Endpoints return JSON and support pagination where applicable.

## Project Management

Our Project has 3 simultaneous tracks, Back-end, Front-end, Database System, that are managed by developer leads corresponding to those tracks. The team lead assigns tasks according to each person’s desired skill set and strengths, and team members are allowed to request a change in task if they don’t feel confident about completing a task. Deadlines are set realistically, and the team lead checks in with members regularly to make sure quality standards are met, the project is on track, and members have unconditional support from the team. The members will push their work to the development branch, and the team lead will push to the main branch after revising and quality checking. Microsoft Excel is used as the main tracker for our WellNest project. Members can find their tasks, resources, task descriptions, and due dates on the tracker. Members can report their task percentage completed on the tracker, so other members working on related and simultaneous tasks know when the handover will happen. Meeting scheduling takes place on Discord along with all team communication. If a member fails to join a meeting, a recording of the meeting will be posted on Discord, and their tasks will be posted on the tracker. Members working together on a task should set their own deadlines, and push their completed work to the GitHub repo before its due date. All major decisions will be made in consultation with the entire team and finalized based on majority agreement.

## Data Definitions

1. User

   Users are the people who interact with the app. Each person has a profile that includes their username, first and last name, email, gender, and a securely encrypted password. The system also tracks the date the user joined (created_at). Users can create custom habits and participate in wellness circles.
   Users are the people who interact with the app. Each person has a profile that includes their username, first and last name, email, gender, and a securely encrypted password. The system also tracks the date the user joined (created_at). Users can create custom habits and participate in wellness circles.

2. Habit

   This is an abstract table that serves as the general structure for all habits. It does not store any attributes itself but acts as a parent to both Custom_Habit and Defined_Habit. Its purpose is to provide a unified structure for different types of habits that can be tracked in the system.

3. Custom_Habit

   Custom habits are routines defined by users themselves. Each habit includes a descriptive name, the value recorded (like “2L” for water or “30 mins” for a workout), and the timestamp of when it was recorded. Every custom habit is tied to the user_id of the person who created it. This model directly inherits from the abstract Habit class.

4. Defined_Habit

   Defined habits are preconfigured routines that come built into the app, such as “Drink Water” or “Morning Walk.” These habits inherit from the abstract Habit entity and do not contain any additional attributes. They offer users a quick-start option and promote uniformity across wellness circles.

5. Wellnest_Circle

   A Wellnest Circle is a group created to support shared health goals. Each group can have only one goal assigned to it. Users can join multiple wellness circles—either by creating one themselves or by joining a group started by another user.

6. Joins

   This is an associative entity that links users to wellness circles. Since users can belong to many groups and groups can have many users, this table handles the many-to-many relationship cleanly.

7. Leaderboard

   The leaderboard keeps track of each user’s score within a specific wellness circle. It records the total score for each user, the group it belongs to, and the last time the leaderboard was updated. This brings in a sense of progress and healthy competition among users.

8. Streak

   Streaks monitor how consistently users stick to a habit. For each user-habit pair, we record the current streak length, the longest streak they've ever had, and when the streak was last updated. It rewards users for forming long-lasting routines.

9. WaterIntake

   This table captures daily water consumption. For every log, it stores how much water was consumed (in milliliters), the user’s ID, and the timestamp of the entry.

10. FoodIntake

    This tracks what the user eats and when. It records the calorie count, timestamp, and type of meal—whether it’s breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Each entry also ties back to the user who logged it.

11. SleepLog

    Sleep logs help track rest. Each entry records the user’s ID, when they fell asleep, when they woke up, and the total number of hours slept. This data helps users monitor sleep patterns over time.

12. WorkoutLog

    Workout logs track physical activity. For each session, it stores the user’s ID, how long they exercised, and when it happened. This supports habit tracking around fitness and physical wellbeing.

EER Diagram

**Database Organization**

The database structure for our WellNest app has been thoughtfully designed to align with the app’s current functionality, while keeping future improvements in mind. We’re using MySQL as our relational database, and Django for the backend. Instead of relying on Django’s built-in user model, we chose to define custom tables to maintain full control over the schema and adapt it to our specific needs.

At this stage, our schema consists of 10 main tables: User, Custom_Habit, WaterIntake, FoodIntake, WorkoutLog, SleepLog, Wellnest_Circle, Joins, Streak, and Leaderboard. While our conceptual model includes abstract or inherited entities like Habit and Defined_Habit, these do not translate into physical tables in the database.

The schema is well-normalized, which helps reduce redundancy and ensures consistent, reliable data. At the center of the design is the User table, which connects directly to various personal health logs such as WaterIntake, FoodIntake, WorkoutLog, and SleepLog. Each of these includes a foreign key to the User table and uses timestamps for accurate chronological tracking. Foreign keys are used consistently throughout the schema to maintain referential integrity and enforce proper relationships between tables.

To support user-driven habit formation, the Custom_Habit table allows users to define and track their own routines. Consistency over time is tracked via the Streak table, which contributes to user rankings in the Leaderboard. Social engagement is encouraged through wellness groups, which are implemented using the Wellnest_Circle and Joins tables to support many-to-many participation.

As shown in the ER and EER diagrams, each entity has a clearly defined role, and the inheritance logic is handled cleanly through the separation of Custom_Habit and Defined_Habit.

Given the current scope of the project, we've prioritized building a solid foundation with the flexibility to scale in the future. While the current setup is intentionally kept simple for a small user base, it’s been built with future enhancements in mind—such as Docker-based containerization and broader deployment.

In terms of practical use, the schema allows for efficient queries such as: - Retrieving a user's daily water, food, workout, or sleep logs - Listing all wellness circles a user is part of - Identifying users with the longest streaks - Fetching top scorers in each wellness circle - Aggregating health metrics for leaderboard calculations

Overall, the database is cleanly organized, logically structured, and well-prepared to support both the app’s current goals and potential future developments.

## Backend Architecture

**Scalability Diagram**

![Scalability Diagram Version 2](files/Scalability_M2_Team03_1.jpg)

**Architecture Summary**

Our backend system is designed with future scalability, modularity, and security in mind, following microservices principles and anticipating production-level deployment needs. The current implementation lays the groundwork for future enhancements including containerization, replication, caching, and more robust load handling.

**A. Microservices Architecture**

- We follow a microservices architecture, where different backend functionalities are separated into independently manageable services:
  - User Microservice: Responsible for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
  - Group Microservice: Handles creation and management of user groups.
  - Future Microservice: Placeholder for upcoming features (e.g., notifications, analytics).
  - User Microservice: Responsible for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
  - Group Microservice: Handles creation and management of user groups.
  - Future Microservice: Placeholder for upcoming features (e.g., notifications, analytics).

-This design allows us to independently scale, test, and deploy each component as our needs evolve.

**B. Load Balancers (Planned for Future)**

- Although not currently deployed, we plan to integrate Nginx as a reverse proxy and load balancer. In the future, this will:

  - Distribute traffic evenly across microservice instances,
  - Enable SSL termination (HTTPS),
  - Enforce API security via session-based authentication,
  - Optionally introduce rate limiting for abuse prevention.

  - Optionally introduce rate limiting for abuse prevention.

  - Distribute traffic evenly across microservice instances,
  - Enable SSL termination (HTTPS),
  - Enforce API security via session-based authentication,
  - Optionally introduce rate limiting for abuse prevention.

- For now, all requests are routed directly from the frontend to services through a basic Nginx proxy layer.

**C. Caching Strategies (Planned for Future)**

- We plan to use Redis for:

  - Session caching to minimize repeated authentication checks,
  - Query caching to reduce database load on frequent read operations.

  - Session caching to minimize repeated authentication checks,
  - Query caching to reduce database load on frequent read operations.

- While Redis is represented in our architecture for planning purposes, it is not yet in active use.

**D. Reliability and Fault Tolerance (Planned with Containers)**

- Currently, our services are deployed directly on an AWS EC2 instance without container orchestration. As we scale, we plan to use Docker containers to enhance reliability and fault tolerance by:

  - Isolating services to prevent one failure from affecting others,
  - Enabling automatic restarts of crashed containers,
  - Supporting horizontal scaling by spinning up additional container instances.

  - Isolating services to prevent one failure from affecting others,
  - Enabling automatic restarts of crashed containers,
  - Supporting horizontal scaling by spinning up additional container instances.

- These improvements will help us make the most of our existing cloud infrastructure and ensure the system can handle higher loads and failures gracefully.

**E. Containers (Planned with CI/CD Pipeline)**

- Although our code is currently deployed manually or with limited automation, we are planning to use Jenkins (running inside a Docker container) to automate builds and deployment:
  - GitHub → Jenkins (build & test) → Deployment server.
  - This will enable faster CI/CD workflows and consistent deployments.

**F.Data Replication and Consistency (Planned for Scaling Reads)**

- We plan to adopt a primary-replica database architecture using MySQL:

  - The primary DB will handle writes,
  - Read replicas will offload select-heavy operations to boost performance.

  - The primary DB will handle writes,
  - Read replicas will offload select-heavy operations to boost performance.

- This setup is not yet implemented but is part of our scalability roadmap.

**G. Security Considerations**

- We are currently implementing:

  - SSL Termination via Nginx,
  - Session-based authentication to validate API requests.

- We’ve included rate limiting in the architecture diagram as an optional future enhancement to protect the system from misuse. We may also introduce token-based access or API keys for microservice-to-microservice communication when needed.

### UML Diagram

![UMLDiagram2.jpg](files/UMLDiagram2.jpg)

## Coding Standard

Our coding standard is up to par, as our stack is fully utilizing all of the languages that we set out to use for this project. We mainly used CSS, HTML, and python in order to create the websites frontend, and python for the backend. In addition to this, the EER and ERD naming conventions also matched with our functions and methods in each file, maintaining consistency. Overall, the code is clean and very readable to those who might want to take a look at how everything was created. Therefore, when building the documentation, we were able to refer to many of the files in order to track what was done and what hasn't with the naming schemes in our code.

## Frameworks Deployment

When applying the frameworks, we insisted on working with Django, and in order to do so, we had to install the most recent version. In order to fully work with the backend python code, we utilized Django for majority of it. Since utilizing Django, it has created a more structured environment when it came to the python code, along with a more efficient design. Without Django, our backend and front end wouldn't have been possible when it came to running our EC2.

In addition to this, another framework that was a huge help was the EER diagram/table that was made. The diagram allowed us to ensure that the tables and databases that we're connecting to the backend are working correctly with their unique keys. With the tables and keys established in the EER, the relationships have helped greatly when working with the features and design of our product.

## Security Guidelines

User Credentials: Usernames, passwords, email, personal details like gender and full name.

Habit & Health Logs: Data about pre-defined and custom habits

Social Connections: Friends, friend requests, circles, and notifications.

Session Information: Authenticated user sessions and CSRF protection.

Password Encryption
Passwords are encrypted using Django’s built-in set_password() method, which applies a salted hash using PBKDF2 by default. On the front end side the password is not visible.

### Milestone 4

## Post-Analysis: Lessons Learned

Over the course of this milestone our team has encountered many challenges and was able to overcome many of them. Some of the challenges ranged from understanding new technologies, communication between the whole team, misunderstanding role responsibilities, and more. As we progressed through all of the milestones we eventually were able to remedy some of these challenges.

One of the biggest challenges that faced our team was lack of organization on multiple fronts. Initially members were performing roles that were not assigned to them, which caused confusion and rework for some members. This was remedied by having a conversation about what the responsibilities of each role was and how the role cold be fulfilled. Another point of disorganization was not following all of the instructions in the milestone reademe.md. This caused our team unnecessary loss of points. To remedy this, I had created an assignment tracker that gave each member of the team an assignment based off the readme and associated roles. This vastly improved our organization, and we were able to make big strides in our progress. Another guideline I had implemented was making sure my team was constantly updating the chat room. It felt necessary to me that the team was constantly letting everyone know what they were working on and when they had completed their assigned task. This was crucial in keeping general awareness throughout the team as well as providing an extra layer of organization.

Above all attention to detail and communication is paramount. There is no such thing as asking too many questions or overcommunicating. Our team was the strongest when the chat was active and team meetings were long. Everyone would walk away with clarity in those moments. Those who asked the most questions and really took ownership of this project had seen the most success and I hope they take those skills with them moving forward.

Some takeaways are that trust is extremely important as there are so many tasks to juggle in project like this that missed details have strong repercussions. You have to be able to trust that your team is going to show up and do the job they were assigned or face letting down your team. Lack of effort by one person is felt by everyone. With that trust also comes sharing information about your progress and/or struggles so that your team can be there for you. Any instance of not sharing information can hinder the team, cause waste of time, or hard feelings. 

Last but not least there will be times of strong emotions. Those emotions need to be expressed through constructive criticisms and not put downs of others. Nobody is perfect and there will always be mistakes, but as a team you have to get through those mistakes *together*.

Moving forward, if we were to do another project together, I would love to see more sense of ownnership, stronger communication, more questions be asked, and an open mind when criticisms are recieved. The corporate environment wont be as forgiving as the classroom.

Always remember, what you give is what you get.
