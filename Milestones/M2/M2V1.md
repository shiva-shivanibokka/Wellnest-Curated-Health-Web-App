## <mark style="color:blue;">Current Key Risks</mark>

### Skills

Risks:
- Varying skills and technical backgrounds

Proposed Solution:

- Choosing tasks and work carefully, working closely with the task lead

### Scheduale
Risks:

- Time constraints during the summer semester
- Team members being unable to join meetings

Proposed Solution:

- Checking the Tracker regularly
- Watching meeting recordings

### Technical
Risks:

- Most members lack experience working with Python
- Most members lack experience working with SQL
- All members lack experience working with cloud services 

Proposed Solution: 
- Members should watch videos and learn on their own time
- Members should team up with more experienced task leads
- Communicating with team if they don’t feel confident about completing a task

### Teamwork
Risks:	

- First time for many members working on an Agile project
- Time conflict for members working on the same task

Proposed Solution:
- Checking the Tracker regularly
- Communicating with the team
### Legal/Content
Risks: 
- Using copyrighted artwork
- Using copyrighted elements
- Using copied code

Proposed Solution:
- Using Loyalty Free elements
- Creating original artwork
- Regular quality control 


## <mark style="color:blue;">Project Management</mark>

        Our Project has 3 simultaneous tracks, Back-end, Front-end, Database System, that are managed by developer leads corresponding to those tracks. The team lead assigns tasks according to each person’s desired skill set and strengths, and team members are allowed to request a change in task if they don’t feel confident about completing a task. Deadlines are set realistically, and the team lead checks in with members regularly to make sure quality standards are met, the project is on track, and members have unconditional support from the team. The members will push their work to the development branch, and the team lead will push to the main branch after revising and quality checking. Microsoft Excel is used as the main tracker for our WellNest project. Members can find their tasks, resources, task descriptions, and due dates on the tracker. Members can report their task percentage completed on the tracker, so other members working on related and simultaneous tasks know when the handover will happen. Meeting scheduling takes place on Discord along with all team communication. If a member fails to join a meeting, a recording of the meeting will be posted on Discord, and their tasks will be posted on the tracker. Members working together on a task should set their own deadlines, and push their completed work to the GitHub repo before its due date. All major decisions will be made in consultation with the entire team and finalized based on majority agreement.
