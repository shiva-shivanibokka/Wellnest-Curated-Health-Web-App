## <mark style="color:blue;">Executive Summary</mark>

In today's society, where sedentary lifestyles and inconsistent routines increasingly compromise every individual’s physical and mental health, there’s a need for a solution to combat this. This is where our product would come into play: Wellnest, a socially driven mobile application that assists users in monitoring healthy habits and setting and achieving personal wellness goals, resulting in a more balanced life.

Our product, Wellnest, offers a complete hub in which users can track their healthy habits. Unlike other apps in the market that mainly focus on more narrow metrics like steps and calories, Wellnest enables users to log and manage a wide range of their habits. Some examples of the features would be to track food and water intake, weekly sleep patterns, physical activity, and more specific habits like smoking and alcohol intake. The app will essentially take all this data and generate a personalized dashboard catering to the individual user to monitor the trends and track their progress over time.

A key feature that Wellnest offers is its “Wellness Circle”, enabling users to connect with friends and family within a competitive environment to the health challenges. These challenges would consist of hydration goals, daily steps, sleeping habits, etc. This social component will transform health tracking into a more engaging environment shared with other users, creating an incentive to stick to a routine to stay ahead.

On top of the manual tracking feature available, Wellnest will utilize AI-powered insights and behavioral nudges to remind users to stay on track. Essentially, Wellnest will include smart reminders, adaptive suggestions, and milestone celebrations to make the app feel less like a tracker, but a personal digital trainer. This is designed to maintain engagement and to consistently encourage long-term behavioral change.

With the user’s personal experience in mind, we aim to build this with scalability to support future architecture and expansions of Wellnest. From integration with wearable devices, mood tracking, to mindfulness modules, this would allow us as the developers of the app to understand our users’ experience to decide what features are working and which are not. The app itself also prioritizes data privacy, utilizing secure protocols to ensure the protection of user information not being compromised.

When taking a look from a technical standpoint, our goal is to develop a platform that is not just robust and secure, but rather impactful to each user. We believe that Wellnest fills a critical gap in today’s market by encompassing the idea of an all-in-one health companion. This promotes consistency, self-awareness, and community, which are essentially the key pillars of an ideal healthy lifestyle to incorporate in a user’s day-to-day. By combining aspects of a thoughtful design, smart technology, and a deep understanding of user motivation, Wellnest aims to become more than just an app lost in your app library, but a companion for self-growth.

### Use Cases:

#### **Signing Up and Setting Up Health Goals**

**Actor:** **Rhea (Graduate Student)**

Rhea hears about Wellnest from a friend and decides to give it a try. She downloads the app and selects the “Sign Up” option. She enters her name, email, and password, and agrees to the privacy terms. After account creation, the app prompts her to select focus areas such as hydration, food logging, and sleep improvement. Rhea sets a goal of drinking 2 liters of water daily and sleeping 7 hours per night. She enables smart reminders and selects “gentle” tone for notifications. She’s also invited to join the “30-Day Sleep Reset Challenge” with her classmates.

#### **Logging and Controlling Smoking/Alcohol Habits**

**Actor:** **Devon (Tech Professional)**

Devon is a social drinker and occasional smoker. He wants to cut down both habits and track how often they occur. On Wellnest, he enables the “Habit Control” module and sets reduction goals: no more than 2 alcoholic drinks per week and zero cigarettes.

Each time he smokes or drinks (e.g., beer at happy hour or a cigarette during breaks), he logs it in the app. After two weeks, Wellnest detects that his smoking frequency hasn’t decreased and sends a reflective insight:

**“You’ve exceeded your cigarette goal 3 times. Try shifting your evening habit to chamomile tea or a short walk — want to try the Healthy Evening Swap plan?”**

Devon accepts. The app enables “replacement reminders” and sends encouraging nudges at his usual craving times. After a month, Devon reduces both habits by over 40%.

#### **Identifying Junk Food Patterns and Suggesting Alternatives**

**Actor:** **Mary (Homemaker)**

Mary often snacks on highly processed foods, especially when under stress. She logs her meals honestly — including frozen pizza, potato chips, and fast food like burgers and fries. After 10 days of consistent tracking, Wellnest detects a pattern:

**“50% of your logged meals are categorized as high in sodium or saturated fat. Want healthier 15-minute alternatives for your cravings?”**

Mary clicks _Yes_, and Wellnest recommends recipes like baked sweet potato fries, turkey lettuce wraps, and homemade veggie quesadillas. It also enables a _Smart Substitution Alert_ — when Mary logs a high-calorie snack, it gently suggests a swap with a healthier option.

Over time, Mary starts incorporating small changes that significantly reduce her reliance on junk food, without feeling deprived.

![Screenshot_9.jpg](images/Screenshot_9.jpg)

#### **Smart Weekly Insights and Course Correction**

**Actor:** **Jenny (Corporate Manager)**

Jenny uses Wellnest consistently to track sleep, meals, and caffeine intake. On Sunday, the app sends her a Weekly Wellness Snapshot. One week, she notices a flag:

**“Your average sleep dropped to 5.5 hours this week. Caffeine intake after 6 PM was logged 4 times.”**

Wellnest recommends activating a “Caffeine Curfew” plan. Jenny agrees, enabling gentle evening nudges and replacing late-night coffee with herbal tea options. Within two weeks, her average sleep improves to over 7 hours.

![Screenshot_10.jpg](images/Screenshot_10.jpg)

#### **Competing in a Wellness Challenge for Motivation**

**Actor:** **Arnold (College Athlete)**

Arnold joins a “No Soda for 7 Days” challenge through the Wellness Circle. The app sends daily motivation tips and lets him track sugary beverage intake. On Day 3, he logs a can of soda. The app responds:

**“No worries! You’re still in the game. Want to offset it with a brisk 20-minute walk?”**

He completes the walk and earns a recovery point. At the end of the challenge, Arnold earns a bronze badge and shares his win with his teammates — helping everyone stay motivated and accountable.

![Screenshot_11.jpg](images/Screenshot_11.jpg)

#### **Customizing Notifications and Privacy Settings**

**Actor:** **Rhea (Graduate Student)**

After a few days of using Wellnest, Rhea finds the notifications a bit distracting during class. She opens Settings and customizes her experience:

- Quiet Hours: 9 AM – 2 PM (no notifications during lectures)
- Health summaries: Only at 8 PM
- Privacy mode: On (hides health stats on lock screen)

Wellnest respects her preferences, and her daily experience becomes smoother and more focused.

![Screenshot_12.jpg](images/Screenshot_12.jpg)

#### **Syncing with a Wearable Device for Passive Tracking**

**Actor: Arnold (College Athlete)**

Arnold connects his Apple Watch to Wellnest via the app's “Sync Devices” section. With a few taps, his step count, resting heart rate, and sleep hours sync automatically. The app now uses this data to recommend active recovery days and hydration tips post-workout. He no longer needs to log anything manually — just focuses on staying consistent.

![Screenshot_13.jpg](images/Screenshot_13.jpg)

#### **Previewing Mood Tracking and Emotional Wellness Insights**

**Actor:** **Mary (Homemaker)**

Mary enables the beta “Mood & Energy Tracker” feature. Every evening, she receives a question: _“How was your day?”_ with mood emojis and a short text box. One night she logs: _“Felt low — kids were sick, grabbed drive-thru on the way home.”_

After a week, the app notes: **“Lower moods are consistently logged on days with less than 6 hours of sleep and fast food meals. Try prepping easy grab-and-go options like a turkey sandwich or fruit parfait.”**

Mary appreciates the insight and begins following a “Simple Meals for Busy Days” plan recommended by Wellnest, making small but meaningful shifts toward emotional and physical balance.

With the above table, it becomes evident that while most competing health apps offer selective features like food logging, sleep tracking, or wearable syncing, they often operate in silos and lack a unified, user-centric approach. Additionally, several apps place essential features like habit insights or social engagement behind premium subscriptions, limiting accessibility for many users. Wellnest fills this gap by offering a holistic platform that combines core habit tracking (food, sleep, hydration, exercise) with often-overlooked aspects like mood logging and smoking/alcohol control. What sets Wellnest apart is its use of AI to provide personalized nudges, adaptive suggestions, and wellness insights — all without overwhelming the user. The inclusion of a "Wellness Circle" introduces a community-driven model where users can challenge, support, and grow with one another. Moreover, while full wearable integration is on the roadmap, Wellnest ensures that users can gain value even without external devices, making it both inclusive and scalable. In essence, Wellnest isn't just another health tracker — it is a smart, supportive companion that promotes sustainable lifestyle change through personalization, empathy, and social accountability. These differentiators position Wellnest uniquely in a crowded market and make it a promising alternative to traditional wellness apps.

## <mark style="color:blue;">UI Mockup and Storyboards</mark>

### Rhea Sign-up Scenario

Reah Sign-ins to the Wellnest app after inputting her Username, Email, and Password. In the Main page she sees a calendar, an inspirational quote, and a text from the app welcoming her. She has not created any pre-existing nor custom habits, but she has a notification from a friend who suggested the app to her. She clicks on the notification and navigates to the socials page. She has not added any friends but she can join a wellness circle managed by Jake. After accepting the challenge, she navigates to the challenge page and sees the progress everyone has made towards the challenge, her standing on the leaderboard, and the participants of the challenge in her Wellness circle.

### Creating Habits Scenario

Devon uses the Wellnest app every day. Today, he opened the app and sees that he has 3 habits left to do today: Walking, Reading, and Not Smoking. He wishes to add another custom habit / task. He clicks on the add habit button in the nav bar or under the To Do list and an overlay opens for him to customize a new task. He can choose the task name, description, time, duration, etc. After he is done he will click the Done button, and the overlay will close.

### Habits / Challenges types and pages

Mary opens the Wellnest app and sees three different kinds of tasks/ habits that Wellnest offers:

1. Personal habits that are pre-existing or she has customly created for herself.
1. Group habits that have been created by other people and she has joined.
1. Friendly challenges that only she and her friend are a part of.

She clicks on one of the challenges and navigates to the page of that challenge, viewing the information, statistics, and leaderboard of the challenge.

## <mark style="color:blue;">High-Level System Design</mark>

### <mark style="color:blue;">Database Architecture</mark>

Our app’s backend database is designed to support both individual health tracking and group-based wellness challenges. Users can log daily health activities like water intake, food intake, sleep, workouts, and habits. In addition, users can monitor health metrics such as weight, BMI, body fat percentage, muscle mass, height, and age.
While group challenges are available, users are not required to join a group to use the app. The system also tracks progress streaks. The structure emphasizes clean data organization, time-based tracking, and performance.

**DBMS Selection**
We selected MySQL, hosted on AWS EC2, as our backend database. MySQL integrates well with our Django framework and supports relational models, foreign keys, and indexing — all of which are critical for managing user-specific logs and group tracking in a scalablity, and reliability.

![DB Organization.jpg](images/DB%20Organization.png)

- A User can log multiple entries across all tracking tables
- A User can join multiple Groups
- Each Group has one GroupChallenge
- GroupParticipation logs each user's membership and completion status
- Leaderboard tracks performance by group and user
- HabitLog is used to record numerical data related to habits (e.g., “drank 2 cups of coffee”)

![ERD_M2_Team03.jpg](images/ERD_M2_Team03.jpg)

**Media Storage**
The application does not support any media uploads. All data is purely structured (text and numeric), making the system easier to scale and manage. This choice also improves performance by eliminating the need to handle binary files or external storage systems.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Backend Architecture</mark>

![Scalability_M2_Team03.jpg](images/Scalability_M2_Team03.jpg)

**Architecture Summary**

Our system is built using a microservices architecture, with separate services for handling user data and group management. These services interact with a shared MySQL database. We plan to deploy them on an AWS EC2 instance Apache 2 server, using Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment.
We might also use containers (Docker) to package and run our microservices, which would make it easier to scale them in the future and ensure consistent environments across development and production.
From a security standpoint, we will ensure that all data exchanged between components is encrypted using HTTPS, and sensitive user data (like passwords) is stored securely using hashing and encryption mechanisms in the database.

### High Level APIs and Main Algorithms

For this project, we will implement a set of APIs split across microservices (User Service, Group Service). These APIs will manage user data, group participation, logging various health-related data, and provides personalized evaluation report to users.

**User Service APIs**

- Manage user profiles (creation, deletion, update)
- Record health metrics (BMI, muscle mass, body fat, etc.)
- Log water intake, food intake, sleep, and workout sessions
- Retrieve personalized user summaries based on recent activity and trends

**Group Service APIs**

- Create and manage groups
- Allow users to join or leave groups
- Track group challenge participation and completion status
- Maintain leaderboards showing group rankings

**Main Algorithms**

**Personalized Evaluation Report Page**

- A user-friendly page in the app where users can view a summary of their health metrics, logs, and progress. This page allows users to check both hourly logs and a daily summary in one place. The system does not continuously evaluate data or push updates; instead, users can visit the page anytime to view their personalized information.

## <mark style="color:blue;">Current Key Risks</mark>

### Skills

**Risks**

- Varying skills and technical backgrounds

**Proposed Solution:**

- Choosing tasks and work carefully, working closely with the task lead

### Schedule

**Risks**

- Time constraints during the summer semester
- Team members being unable to join meetings

**Proposed Solution**

- Checking the Tracker regularly
- Watching meeting recordings

### Technical

**Risks**

- Most members lack experience working with Python
- Most members lack experience working with SQL
- All members lack experience working with cloud services

**Proposed Solution**

- Members should watch videos and learn on their own time
- Members should team up with more experienced task leads
- Communicating with team if they don’t feel confident about completing a task

### Teamwork

**Risks**

- First time for many members working on an Agile project
- Time conflict for members working on the same task

**Proposed Solution**

- Checking the Tracker regularly
- Communicating with the team

### Legal/Content

**Risks**

- Using copyrighted artwork
- Using copyrighted elements
- Using copied code

**Proposed Solution**

- Using Loyalty Free elements
- Creating original artwork
- Regular quality control

## <mark style="color:blue;">Project Management</mark>

Our Project has 3 simultaneous tracks, Back-end, Front-end, Database System, that are managed by developer leads corresponding to those tracks. The team lead assigns tasks according to each person’s desired skill set and strengths, and team members are allowed to request a change in task if they don’t feel confident about completing a task. Deadlines are set realistically, and the team lead checks in with members regularly to make sure quality standards are met, the project is on track, and members have unconditional support from the team. The members will push their work to the development branch, and the team lead will push to the main branch after revising and quality checking. Microsoft Excel is used as the main tracker for our WellNest project. Members can find their tasks, resources, task descriptions, and due dates on the tracker. Members can report their task percentage completed on the tracker, so other members working on related and simultaneous tasks know when the handover will happen. Meeting scheduling takes place on Discord along with all team communication. If a member fails to join a meeting, a recording of the meeting will be posted on Discord, and their tasks will be posted on the tracker. Members working together on a task should set their own deadlines, and push their completed work to the GitHub repo before its due date. All major decisions will be made in consultation with the entire team and finalized based on majority agreement.
