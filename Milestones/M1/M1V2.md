## <mark style="color:blue;">Executive Summary</mark>

In today's society, where sedentary lifestyles and inconsistent routines increasingly compromise every individual’s physical and mental health, there’s a need for a solution to combat this. This is where our product would come into play: Wellnest, a socially driven mobile application that assists users in monitoring healthy habits and setting and achieving personal wellness goals, resulting in a more balanced life.

Our product, Wellnest, offers a complete hub in which users can track their healthy habits. Unlike other apps in the market that mainly focus on more narrow metrics like steps and calories, Wellnest enables users to log and manage a wide range of their habits. Some examples of the features would be to track food and water intake, weekly sleep patterns, physical activity, and more specific habits like smoking and alcohol intake. The app will essentially take all this data and generate a personalized dashboard catering to the individual user to monitor the trends and track their progress over time.

A key feature that Wellnest offers is its “Wellness Circle”, enabling users to connect with friends and family within a competitive environment to the health challenges. These challenges would consist of hydration goals, daily steps, sleeping habits, etc. This social component will transform health tracking into a more engaging environment shared with other users, creating an incentive to stick to a routine to stay ahead.

On top of the manual tracking feature available, Wellnest will utilize AI-powered insights and behavioral nudges to remind users to stay on track. Essentially, Wellnest will include smart reminders, adaptive suggestions, and milestone celebrations to make the app feel less like a tracker, but a personal digital trainer. This is designed to maintain engagement and to consistently encourage long-term behavioral change.

With the user’s personal experience in mind, we aim to build this with scalability to support future architecture and expansions of Wellnest. From integration with wearable devices, mood tracking, to mindfulness modules, this would allow us as the developers of the app to understand our users’ experience to decide what features are working and which are not. The app itself also prioritizes data privacy, utilizing secure protocols to ensure the protection of user information not being compromised.

When taking a look from a technical standpoint, our goal is to develop a platform that is not just robust and secure, but rather impactful to each user. We believe that Wellnest fills a critical gap in today’s market by encompassing the idea of an all-in-one health companion. This promotes consistency, self-awareness, and community, which are essentially the key pillars of an ideal healthy lifestyle to incorporate in a user’s day-to-day. By combining aspects of a thoughtful design, smart technology, and a deep understanding of user motivation, Wellnest aims to become more than just an app lost in your app library, but a companion for self-growth.

### Use Cases:

#### **Signing Up and Setting Up Health Goals**

**Actor:** **Rhea (Graduate Student)**

Rhea hears about Wellnest from a friend and decides to give it a try. She downloads the app and selects the “Sign Up” option. She enters her name, email, and password, and agrees to the privacy terms. After account creation, the app prompts her to select focus areas such as hydration, food logging, and sleep improvement. Rhea sets a goal of drinking 2 liters of water daily and sleeping 7 hours per night. She enables smart reminders and selects “gentle” tone for notifications. She’s also invited to join the “30-Day Sleep Reset Challenge” with her classmates.

#### **Logging and Controlling Smoking/Alcohol Habits**

**Actor:** **Devon (Tech Professional)**

Devon is a social drinker and occasional smoker. He wants to cut down both habits and track how often they occur. On Wellnest, he enables the “Habit Control” module and sets reduction goals: no more than 2 alcoholic drinks per week and zero cigarettes.

Each time he smokes or drinks (e.g., beer at happy hour or a cigarette during breaks), he logs it in the app. After two weeks, Wellnest detects that his smoking frequency hasn’t decreased and sends a reflective insight:

**“You’ve exceeded your cigarette goal 3 times. Try shifting your evening habit to chamomile tea or a short walk — want to try the Healthy Evening Swap plan?”**

Devon accepts. The app enables “replacement reminders” and sends encouraging nudges at his usual craving times. After a month, Devon reduces both habits by over 40%.

#### **Identifying Junk Food Patterns and Suggesting Alternatives**

**Actor:** **Mary (Homemaker)**

Mary often snacks on highly processed foods, especially when under stress. She logs her meals honestly — including frozen pizza, potato chips, and fast food like burgers and fries. After 10 days of consistent tracking, Wellnest detects a pattern:

**“50% of your logged meals are categorized as high in sodium or saturated fat. Want healthier 15-minute alternatives for your cravings?”**

Mary clicks _Yes_, and Wellnest recommends recipes like baked sweet potato fries, turkey lettuce wraps, and homemade veggie quesadillas. It also enables a _Smart Substitution Alert_ — when Mary logs a high-calorie snack, it gently suggests a swap with a healthier option.

Over time, Mary starts incorporating small changes that significantly reduce her reliance on junk food, without feeling deprived.

#### **Smart Weekly Insights and Course Correction**

**Actor:** **Jenny (Corporate Manager)**

Jenny uses Wellnest consistently to track sleep, meals, and caffeine intake. On Sunday, the app sends her a Weekly Wellness Snapshot. One week, she notices a flag:

**“Your average sleep dropped to 5.5 hours this week. Caffeine intake after 6 PM was logged 4 times.”**

Wellnest recommends activating a “Caffeine Curfew” plan. Jenny agrees, enabling gentle evening nudges and replacing late-night coffee with herbal tea options. Within two weeks, her average sleep improves to over 7 hours.

![Screenshot\_10.jpg](images/Screenshot_10.jpg)

#### **Competing in a Wellness Challenge for Motivation**

**Actor:** **Arnold (College Athlete)**

Arnold joins a “No Soda for 7 Days” challenge through the Wellness Circle. The app sends daily motivation tips and lets him track sugary beverage intake. On Day 3, he logs a can of soda. The app responds:

**“No worries! You’re still in the game. Want to offset it with a brisk 20-minute walk?”**

He completes the walk and earns a recovery point. At the end of the challenge, Arnold earns a bronze badge and shares his win with his teammates — helping everyone stay motivated and accountable.

#### **Customizing Notifications and Privacy Settings**

**Actor:** **Rhea (Graduate Student)**

After a few days of using Wellnest, Rhea finds the notifications a bit distracting during class. She opens Settings and customizes her experience:

* Quiet Hours: 9 AM – 2 PM (no notifications during lectures)
* Health summaries: Only at 8 PM
* Privacy mode: On (hides health stats on lock screen)

Wellnest respects her preferences, and her daily experience becomes smoother and more focused.

![Screenshot\_12.jpg](images/Screenshot_12.jpg)

#### **Syncing with a Wearable Device for Passive Tracking**

**Actor: Arnold (College Athlete)**

Arnold connects his Apple Watch to Wellnest via the app's “Sync Devices” section. With a few taps, his step count, resting heart rate, and sleep hours sync automatically. The app now uses this data to recommend active recovery days and hydration tips post-workout. He no longer needs to log anything manually — just focuses on staying consistent.

![Screenshot\_13.jpg](images/Screenshot_13.jpg)

#### **Previewing Mood Tracking and Emotional Wellness Insights**

**Actor:** **Mary (Homemaker)**

Mary enables the beta “Mood & Energy Tracker” feature. Every evening, she receives a question: _“How was your day?”_ with mood emojis and a short text box. One night she logs: _“Felt low — kids were sick, grabbed drive-thru on the way home.”_

After a week, the app notes: **“Lower moods are consistently logged on days with less than 6 hours of sleep and fast food meals. Try prepping easy grab-and-go options like a turkey sandwich or fruit parfait.”**

Mary appreciates the insight and begins following a “Simple Meals for Busy Days” plan recommended by Wellnest, making small but meaningful shifts toward emotional and physical balance.

## <mark style="color:blue;">Competitive Analysis</mark>

<figure><img src="images/Screenshot_17.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

![Screenshot\_15.jpg](images/Screenshot_15.jpg)

With the above table, it becomes evident that while most competing health apps offer selective features like food logging, sleep tracking, or wearable syncing, they often operate in silos and lack a unified, user-centric approach. Additionally, several apps place essential features like habit insights or social engagement behind premium subscriptions, limiting accessibility for many users. Wellnest fills this gap by offering a holistic platform that combines core habit tracking (food, sleep, hydration, exercise) with often-overlooked aspects like mood logging and smoking/alcohol control. What sets Wellnest apart is its use of AI to provide personalized nudges, adaptive suggestions, and wellness insights — all without overwhelming the user. The inclusion of a "Wellness Circle" introduces a community-driven model where users can challenge, support, and grow with one another. Moreover, while full wearable integration is on the roadmap, Wellnest ensures that users can gain value even without external devices, making it both inclusive and scalable. In essence, Wellnest isn't just another health tracker — it is a smart, supportive companion that promotes sustainable lifestyle change through personalization, empathy, and social accountability. These differentiators position Wellnest uniquely in a crowded market and make it a promising alternative to traditional wellness apps.
