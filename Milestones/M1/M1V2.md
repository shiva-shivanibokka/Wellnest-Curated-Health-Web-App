## <mark style="color:blue;">Executive Summary</mark>

In today's society, where sedentary lifestyles and inconsistent routines increasingly compromise every individual’s physical and mental health, there’s a need for a solution to combat this. This is where our product would come into play: Wellnest, a socially driven mobile application that assists users in monitoring healthy habits and setting and achieving personal wellness goals, resulting in a more balanced life.

Our product, Wellnest, offers a complete hub in which users can track their healthy habits. Unlike other apps in the market that mainly focus on more narrow metrics like steps and calories, Wellnest enables users to log and manage a wide range of their habits. Some examples of the features would be to track food and water intake, weekly sleep patterns, physical activity, and more specific habits like smoking and alcohol intake. The app will essentially take all this data and generate a personalized dashboard catering to the individual user to monitor the trends and track their progress over time.

A key feature that Wellnest offers is its “Wellness Circle”, enabling users to connect with friends and family within a competitive environment to the health challenges. These challenges would consist of hydration goals, daily steps, sleeping habits, etc. This social component will transform health tracking into a more engaging environment shared with other users, creating an incentive to stick to a routine to stay ahead.

On top of the manual tracking feature available, Wellnest will utilize AI-powered insights and behavioral nudges to remind users to stay on track. Essentially, Wellnest will include smart reminders, adaptive suggestions, and milestone celebrations to make the app feel less like a tracker, but a personal digital trainer. This is designed to maintain engagement and to consistently encourage long-term behavioral change.

With the user’s personal experience in mind, we aim to build this with scalability to support future architecture and expansions of Wellnest. From integration with wearable devices, mood tracking, to mindfulness modules, this would allow us as the developers of the app to understand our users’ experience to decide what features are working and which are not. The app itself also prioritizes data privacy, utilizing secure protocols to ensure the protection of user information not being compromised.

When taking a look from a technical standpoint, our goal is to develop a platform that is not just robust and secure, but rather impactful to each user. We believe that Wellnest fills a critical gap in today’s market by encompassing the idea of an all-in-one health companion. This promotes consistency, self-awareness, and community, which are essentially the key pillars of an ideal healthy lifestyle to incorporate in a user’s day-to-day. By combining aspects of a thoughtful design, smart technology, and a deep understanding of user motivation, Wellnest aims to become more than just an app lost in your app library, but a companion for self-growth.

### Use Cases:

#### **#1\. Signing Up and Setting Up Health Goals**

**Actor:** Rhea (Graduate Student)

**Assumptions:** Rhea has a smartphone and internet access

**Use Case:**

Rhea is a full-time student who struggles with staying hydrated and getting consistent sleep. After hearing about Wellnest from a classmate, she installs the app on her phone. She taps on "Sign Up," creates an account, and selects hydration and sleep as her focus areas. She sets a target of 2 liters of water daily and at least 7 hours of sleep each night. The app offers her gentle reminders and invites her to join a 30-Day Sleep Challenge with other students, which she accepts.

**Benefits:**

* Helps Rhea stay properly hydrated by reminding her throughout the day, which is especially helpful when she’s busy with classes

* Encourages her to prioritize sleep by setting realistic, consistent targets and tracking her progress.

* Keeps her accountable through social challenges and gentle nudges without overwhelming her.

* Builds a healthy routine gradually, making it easier to stick with over time

#### **2\. Logging and Reducing Smoking/Alcohol Habits**

**Actor:** Devon (Tech Professional)

**Assumptions:** Devon wants to cut back on cigarettes and on social as well as personal drinking habits.

**Use case:**

Devon is a 32-year-old software developer who has been a chain smoker for years and tends to drink regularly — both during and after work, and during social events. He’s aware that these habits are affecting his health, but hasn’t been able to track or reduce them consistently. On the suggestion of a colleague, he installs Wellnest and starts logging every cigarette and alcoholic drink.

After two weeks of tracking, the app shows him a pattern: his smoking peaks during late-night work and alcohol intake is highest on weekends. It then suggests a personalized Evening Swap Plan, offering alternative substitutes like chamomile tea, music, or short breathing exercises. Devon enables the plan and starts receiving gentle nudges at his usual smoking and drinking times. Over the next month, he begins to log fewer instances, and the app acknowledges his progress with supportive messages and weekly summaries.

**Benefits:**

* Helps Devon clearly see when and why he smokes or drinks

* Offers practical, non-judgmental alternatives based on his lifestyle

* Reinforces progress with positive feedback instead of guilt

* Keeps him engaged with simple daily choices that add up to meaningful change over time

![Devon.png](images/Devon.png)

#### **3\. Identifying Junk Food Patterns and Suggesting Alternatives**

**Actor:** Mary (Homemaker)

**Assumption:** Mary wants to eat healthier but tends to stress-eat when overwhelmed

**Use Case:**

Mary, a full-time homemaker, often finds herself reaching for chips, cookies, or processed meals during moments of stress or exhaustion. She decides to try Wellnest to log her meals and gain more control over her eating habits. After a week of consistent logging, the app identifies a pattern of high-calorie, high-sodium foods, especially in the afternoons and evenings. It notifies her and offers healthier, quick-prep snack alternatives like hummus with veggies or Greek yogurt with fruit.

Mary enables Smart Substitution Alerts, which offer better choices in real-time when she logs similar processed items. Although she occasionally returns to her old patterns, she becomes more conscious of what she’s eating. Even when she indulges, she logs it honestly — and the app responds with encouragement, not guilt. Over time, Mary develops a more balanced relationship with food, choosing healthier options more frequently and understanding her triggers better.

**Benefits:**

* Builds real awareness around stress-eating habits and food choices

* Provides helpful and realistic alternatives that fit her daily routine.

* Encourages consistency without guilt, even when setbacks happen

* Supports long-term habit change by helping Mary understand and manage her triggers

![Mary.png](images/Mary.png)

#### **4\. Weekly Insight and Adjustment**

**Actor:** Jenny (Corporate Manager)

**Assumptions:** Jenny regularly logs caffeine intake and sleep patterns using a health app

**Use Case:**

Jenny is a high-performing professional who works long hours, often late into the night. To keep up, she relies heavily on caffeine — mostly through coffee but sometimes energy drinks as well. Her average sleep time is under 4 hours, even on weekends. She begins using Wellnest to track her daily caffeine consumption and sleep duration.

After a week of data collection, Wellnest identifies that her late-night caffeine intake is severely impacting her sleep. It suggests a “Caffeine Curfew” and prompts her to shift to non-caffeinated drinks in the evening. Jenny enables this feature and receives gentle reminders to wind down. Over time, the app helps her replace evening coffee with herbal teas, and her sleep duration gradually increases. The weekly report shows clear improvement, and the consistent nudges keep her motivated to continue making better choices.

**Benefits:**

* Makes the connection between caffeine intake and sleep disruption clear and easy to understand.

* Provides personalized, manageable steps without overwhelming the user

* Reinforces small improvements through weekly reports and visible progress

* Helps Jenny begin a gradual but meaningful shift toward healthier routines despite her demanding lifestyle

![Jenny.png](images/Jenny.png)

#### **5\. Social Motivation Through Challenges**

**Actor:** Arnold (College Athlete)

**Assumption:** Arnold enjoys competition and is highly conscious of his health and fitness routine

**Use Case:**

Arnold is a state-level athlete who maintains a strict diet and workout routine. While he tries to avoid unhealthy food and drinks, he often finds himself tempted by sodas and the occasional fast food. His trainer has encouraged him to completely cut out sodas and replace them with protein drinks to stay competition-ready.

Arnold uses Wellnest to track his daily food and beverage intake. He signs up for the “No Soda for 7 Days” challenge through the Wellness Circle. On the third day, he logs a soda out of habit. Instead of disqualifying him, the app suggests a recovery activity — a 20-minute high-intensity workout. He completes the task and continues the challenge. Over the course of the week, Arnold becomes more mindful of his beverage choices, and the support from his wellness circle helps him stay on track.

**Benefits:**

* Helps athletes like Arnold build discipline by reinforcing long-term goals through short, manageable challenges

* Turns slip-ups into learning opportunities rather than setbacks.

* Keeps motivation high with encouragement and achievement badges

* Promotes consistency and mindfulness, which are crucial for athletes working to improve performance and health habits

With the above table, it becomes evident that while most competing health apps offer selective features like food logging, sleep tracking, or wearable syncing, they often operate in silos and lack a unified, user-centric approach. Additionally, several apps place essential features like habit insights or social engagement behind premium subscriptions, limiting accessibility for many users. Wellnest fills this gap by offering a holistic platform that combines core habit tracking (food, sleep, hydration, exercise) with often-overlooked aspects like mood logging and smoking/alcohol control. What sets Wellnest apart is its use of AI to provide personalized nudges, adaptive suggestions, and wellness insights — all without overwhelming the user. The inclusion of a "Wellness Circle" introduces a community-driven model where users can challenge, support, and grow with one another. Moreover, while full wearable integration is on the roadmap, Wellnest ensures that users can gain value even without external devices, making it both inclusive and scalable. In essence, Wellnest isn't just another health tracker — it is a smart, supportive companion that promotes sustainable lifestyle change through personalization, empathy, and social accountability. These differentiators position Wellnest uniquely in a crowded market and make it a promising alternative to traditional wellness apps.
