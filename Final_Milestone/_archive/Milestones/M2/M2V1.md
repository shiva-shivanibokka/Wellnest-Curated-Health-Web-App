## <mark style="color:blue;">UI Mockup and Storyboards</mark>

### Rhea Sign-up Scenario

Reah Sign-ins to the Wellnest app after inputting her Username, Email, and Password. In the Main page she sees a calendar, an inspirational quote, and a text from the app welcoming her. She has not created any pre-existing nor custom habits, but she has a notification from a friend who suggested the app to her. She clicks on the notification and navigates to the socials page. She has not added any friends but she can join a wellness circle managed by Jake. After accepting the challenge, she navigates to the challenge page and sees the progress everyone has made towards the challenge, her standing on the leaderboard, and the participants of the challenge in her Wellness circle.

![Sign-up Scenario](images/Signup-Rhea.jpg)

### Creating Habits Scenario

Devon uses the Wellnest app every day. Today, he opened the app and sees that he has 3 habits left to do today: Walking, Reading, and Not Smoking. He wishes to add another custom habit / task. He clicks on the add habit button in the nav bar or under the To Do list and an overlay opens for him to customize a new task. He can choose the task name, description, time, duration, etc. After he is done he will click the Done button, and the overlay will close.

![Devon creating habits](images/Custom-Devon.jpg)

### Habits / Challenges types and pages

Mary opens the Wellnest app and sees three different kinds of tasks/ habits that Wellnest offers:

1. Personal habits that are pre-existing or she has customly created for herself.
1. Group habits that have been created by other people and she has joined.
1. Friendly challenges that only she and her friend are a part of.

She clicks on one of the challenges and navigates to the page of that challenge, viewing the information, statistics, and leaderboard of the challenge.

These were some more of the rough designs that we had as well.

## <mark style="color:blue;">High-Level System Design</mark>

### <mark style="color:blue;">Database Architecture</mark>

Our app’s backend database is designed to support both individual health tracking and group-based wellness challenges. Users can log daily health activities like water intake, food intake, sleep, workouts, and habits. In addition, users can monitor health metrics such as weight, BMI, body fat percentage, muscle mass, height, and age.
While group challenges are available, users are not required to join a group to use the app. The system also tracks progress streaks. The structure emphasizes clean data organization, time-based tracking, and performance.

**DBMS Selection**
We selected MySQL, hosted on AWS EC2, as our backend database. MySQL integrates well with our Django framework and supports relational models, foreign keys, and indexing — all of which are critical for managing user-specific logs and group tracking in a scalablity, and reliability.

![DB Organization.jpg](images/DB%20Organization.png)

- A User can log multiple entries across all tracking tables
- A User can join multiple Groups
- Each Group has one GroupChallenge
- GroupParticipation logs each user's membership and completion status
- Leaderboard tracks performance by group and user
- HabitLog is used to record numerical data related to habits (e.g., “drank 2 cups of coffee”)

![ERD_M2_Team03.jpg](images/ERD_M2_Team03.jpg)

**Media Storage**
The application does not support any media uploads. All data is purely structured (text and numeric), making the system easier to scale and manage. This choice also improves performance by eliminating the need to handle binary files or external storage systems.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Backend Architecture</mark>

![Scalability_M2_Team03.jpg](images/Scalability_M2_Team03.jpg)

**Architecture Summary**

Our system is built using a microservices architecture, with separate services for handling user data and group management. These services interact with a shared MySQL database. We plan to deploy them on an AWS EC2 instance Apache 2 server, using Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment.
We might also use containers (Docker) to package and run our microservices, which would make it easier to scale them in the future and ensure consistent environments across development and production.
From a security standpoint, we will ensure that all data exchanged between components is encrypted using HTTPS, and sensitive user data (like passwords) is stored securely using hashing and encryption mechanisms in the database.

**placeholder for descriptions 6.2**

### Application Network and Deployment Design

![Application Network & Deployment Diagram](./images/m2%20app%20netowrks%20deploy.drawio.png)

This illustrates the network and deployment architecture of our web application hosted on an AWS EC2 (t2.micro) instance running Ubuntu 24.04. All services are deployed directly on the EC2 host. Incoming HTTPS requests (port 443) from users are handled by Nginx, which serves as a reverse proxy and manages SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt. Nginx routes frontend requests to a stat HTML/CSS/JS interface served on port 3000 and backend API traffic to a Django 5.2.3 application running on Gunicorn. All inter service communcation occurs over localhost for added security, with the backend connecting to a MySQL database on port 3306.

### High Level APIs and Main Algorithms

For this project, we will implement a set of APIs split across microservices (User Service, Group Service). These APIs will manage user data, group participation, logging various health-related data, and provides personalized evaluation report to users.

**User Service APIs**

- Manage user profiles (creation, deletion, update)
- Record health metrics (BMI, muscle mass, body fat, etc.)
- Log water intake, food intake, sleep, and workout sessions
- Retrieve personalized user summaries based on recent activity and trends

**Group Service APIs**

- Create and manage groups
- Allow users to join or leave groups
- Track group challenge participation and completion status
- Maintain leaderboards showing group rankings

**Main Algorithms**

**Personalized Evaluation Report Page**

- A user-friendly page in the app where users can view a summary of their health metrics, logs, and progress. This page allows users to check both hourly logs and a daily summary in one place. The system does not continuously evaluate data or push updates; instead, users can visit the page anytime to view their personalized information.

## <mark style="color:blue;">Current Key Risks</mark>

### Skills

**Risks**

- Varying skills and technical backgrounds

**Proposed Solution:**

- Choosing tasks and work carefully, working closely with the task lead

### Schedule

**Risks**

- Time constraints during the summer semester
- Team members being unable to join meetings

**Proposed Solution**

- Checking the Tracker regularly
- Watching meeting recordings

### Technical

**Risks**

- Most members lack experience working with Python
- Most members lack experience working with SQL
- All members lack experience working with cloud services

**Proposed Solution**

- Members should watch videos and learn on their own time
- Members should team up with more experienced task leads
- Communicating with team if they don’t feel confident about completing a task

### Teamwork

**Risks**

- First time for many members working on an Agile project
- Time conflict for members working on the same task

**Proposed Solution**

- Checking the Tracker regularly
- Communicating with the team

### Legal/Content

**Risks**

- Using copyrighted artwork
- Using copyrighted elements
- Using copied code

**Proposed Solution**

- Using Loyalty Free elements
- Creating original artwork
- Regular quality control

## <mark style="color:blue;">Project Management</mark>

Our Project has 3 simultaneous tracks, Back-end, Front-end, Database System, that are managed by developer leads corresponding to those tracks. The team lead assigns tasks according to each person’s desired skill set and strengths, and team members are allowed to request a change in task if they don’t feel confident about completing a task. Deadlines are set realistically, and the team lead checks in with members regularly to make sure quality standards are met, the project is on track, and members have unconditional support from the team. The members will push their work to the development branch, and the team lead will push to the main branch after revising and quality checking. Microsoft Excel is used as the main tracker for our WellNest project. Members can find their tasks, resources, task descriptions, and due dates on the tracker. Members can report their task percentage completed on the tracker, so other members working on related and simultaneous tasks know when the handover will happen. Meeting scheduling takes place on Discord along with all team communication. If a member fails to join a meeting, a recording of the meeting will be posted on Discord, and their tasks will be posted on the tracker. Members working together on a task should set their own deadlines, and push their completed work to the GitHub repo before its due date. All major decisions will be made in consultation with the entire team and finalized based on majority agreement.
