# Milestone 1 Docs Revision

## General Feedback

Only two files should be present in the `milestones/M1/` folder: `m1v1.pdf` and `m1v2.pdf`, or their Markdown equivalents. Additional files should not be included, as they make it unnecessarily difficult to locate the correct submissions. All files must be properly organized in their designated directories.

Overall, the milestone submission demonstrates effort; however, it is clear that the work was not reviewed prior to submission. Regular internal review and setting internal deadlines would significantly improve the quality of future milestones.

There are indications that portions of this milestone were generated by AI. This will not be penalized this time, but moving forward, any content identified as AI-generated without explicit permission will result in a zero for the entire team, in accordance with university policy and the course syllabus. It is the responsibility of the team lead to ensure that all submissions are original. Be advised that it only takes a few seconds for me to recognize AI-generated content. Do not risk your grade on this issue.

## Main Page

The table located above your mascot illustration is unclear and does not appear to contribute to the documentation. Unless it adds value, it should be removed.

Each section in this milestone must be clearly separated using a visual separator if Markdown formatting is being used.

## Executive Summary

This section is well-developed. The product vision is clearly stated, and the unique features are effectively described. It provides the reader with a strong overview of the project.

## Main Use Cases

Some use cases, such as those for Customizing Notifications and Privacy Settings, are too detailed and not appropriate for this early stage of development. Details such as privacy mode implementation should not be included at this point.

The formatting of the use cases does not align with what was taught in class. Each use case must begin with a goal and conclude with a statement of benefits. Refer to the slides and lecture recordings for the correct structure.

The diagrams are generally well-made, but there are issues with the depiction of interactions. Each use case diagram must show a single entity interacting with the system. There should not be cases where entities interact with each other while also interacting with the system.

## List of Main Data Items and Entities

This section is very well executed and aligns with expectations.

## Initial List of Functional Requirements

The requirements listed are clearly written and appropriate. However, the quantity is insufficient. In Milestone 1, it is important to list a larger number of functional requirements, as some of them will be refined or removed during the semester. Each entity should have multiple associated functional requirements to provide a comprehensive view of the system’s capabilities.

## List of Non-Functional Requirements

This section must be revised extensively. Several key categories are missing, including but not limited to:

- Coding Standards  
- Look and Feel  
- Privacy  
- Compliance  
- Performance  
- Compatibility  
- Accessibility  
- Environmental Requirements  
- Supportability

Each missing category must be included with specific and measurable non-functional requirements. For example, under Supportability, a requirement might be:  
*“The system shall be supported by Safari browser version 11.1.1.”*

Avoid limiting compatibility to only the latest versions of browsers, as most users will not have the most recent updates installed.

## Competitive Analysis

The structure of this section is generally appropriate. However, there is a critical issue: competitor URLs are missing from the high-level comparison table. These are necessary for validating the research. This omission must be corrected.

In addition, there are signs that some parts of this section may have been generated by AI. As previously noted, this will not be penalized for this milestone, but will not be tolerated in the future. All team members will receive a zero if AI-generated work is submitted without permission.

The team lead is responsible for reviewing all submissions to ensure originality and adherence to expectations.

## Checklist

The checklist section is satisfactory.

It is strongly recommended that the team begin attending office hours. Many other teams have benefited from feedback during these sessions and have improved their milestones significantly. At minimum, one or two short meetings per milestone would allow you to catch and resolve major issues early.

## List of Contributions

The contribution section is incomplete. The team lead failed to provide individual contribution scores. Please review the assignment guidelines and make sure all required elements are included.

## Next Steps

1. Move the file `m1v1.pdf` to the `milestones/M1/` directory.
2. Freeze the contents of `m1v1.pdf` so that no further edits are made. This file will serve as a reference snapshot for future evaluations.
3. Create a new copy named `m1v2` and revise it based on all feedback provided in this document.
4. Submit `m1v2` to the same directory once the revisions are complete.
5. Begin working on `m2v1`.

**Note**:  
`m1v2` is due on the same date as `m2v1`, but it is advised to complete it earlier. The accuracy and quality of `m2v1` will depend directly on how thoroughly you revise and complete `m1v2`.
